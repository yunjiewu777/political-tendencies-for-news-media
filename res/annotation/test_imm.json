        "topic": "Saving DREAMers is only this hard because Donald Trump has made it this hard",
        "date": "2018-02-14",
        "content": "This week , the Senate is debating a solution for DREAMers . Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , making good on his word , brought an empty bill to the floor , permitting both sides to try to round up 60 votes to fill in the text . Inauspiciously , the first day was consumed by a disagreement on where to start . McConnell wanted to begin with a vote on banning sanctuary cities . Chuck Schumer , speaking for the Democrats , demanded the Senate start with President Trump \u2019 s proposal . The dispute was particularly confusing because neither starting point has a remote hope of passage . An argument over which idea to reject first is very Senate 2018 .\nBut it \u2019 s worth zooming out . The public conversation around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program has gotten confused , with everyone agreeing to pretend , for various self-interested reasons , that President Trump actually wants a DACA solution , and fast . Trump and the Republicans have adopted this posture because DREAMers are wildly popular \u2014 giving DREAMers legal status is about twice as popular as Trump himself . Meanwhile , Democrats have agreed to Trump \u2019 s framing of his position because they think it helps pressure Trump into a deal .\nNegotiations on DACA have begun . Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal . Wouldn \u2019 t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the DACA puzzle . This will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! March 5th . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 13 , 2018\nThere is a deep strangeness to this rhetoric . Trump created a crisis for DREAMers \u2014 all this began when he unilaterally decided to end the DACA program \u2014 and then refused the obvious compromises that could have fixed it . Now he is threatening a veto of the likeliest bipartisan compromises in the Senate . He has taken 690,000 hostages and is now trumpeting the wonderful opportunity everyone has to pay his policy ransom in order to free them , and he is doing all of it while insisting he desperately wants to free them too .\nThe truth is , Trump doesn \u2019 t want a DACA solution . He is willing to accept a DACA solution in return for other things he wants \u2014 notably , heavy investments in border security and a large cut in legal immigration \u2014 but within the negotiations , a DACA fix is the thing Trump is treating as a concession on his part , not the thing he is trying to make happen . If it were the thing he was trying to make happen , it would have happened already .\nRight now , the fate of the DREAMers doesn \u2019 t depend mainly on Democrats . It depends on Republicans . If McConnell and Paul Ryan want a deal , they could have one in moments . If Trump wants to save DREAMers , he could do so , and get money for his wall and other border enforcement and immigration changes , tomorrow . But what he actually wants is a suite of restrictionist changes to immigration that are noxious not just to Democrats , but to DREAMers themselves , and he is trying to hide that unpopular agenda behind pro-DREAMer rhetoric , even as he \u2019 s holding DREAMers hostage to pass it .\nThis shell game works until it doesn \u2019 t . If there \u2019 s no deal , and the Trump administration begins deporting DREAMers over Democratic objections , his real position will become very clear , very quickly .\nIf the Senate passes a DREAMer deal , will the House vote on it ?\nWhich bring us back to Congress . My conversations with both Democratic and Republican staffers , both inside and outside of leadership , have ended in unanimous shrugs . No one knows what , if anything , can actually pass the Senate . And the difficulty of that question pales in comparison to the difficulty of what , if anything , can pass the House . Ryan has said he will not bring a bill to the floor that doesn \u2019 t have Trump \u2019 s blessing , and so it is entirely possible that the Senate will pass a deal that never sees a House vote .\nIf that happens , Democrats have little recourse . They \u2019 re in the minority in both the House and the Senate , and after passing last week \u2019 s spending deal , they no longer have the threat of shutting down the government .\nThis is something I got wrong in my initial reaction to the shutdown deal . In preserving the option to shut the government down in the future , I argued , there was no real loss for Democrats , as they hadn \u2019 t abandoned any of their leverage . What I didn \u2019 t appreciate immediately was how much the shutdown had spooked Senate Democrats \u2014 after shutting down the government , they realized they had no strategy for winning the shutdown , and they certainly had no strategy for forcing Trump to fold amid the kind of high-stakes cable news showdown he lives for . So while the shutdown deal held open the option of a future shutdown , in fact , that option had closed , because Senate Democrats had lost faith in it . Now it \u2019 s gone entirely .\nOver the past week , I \u2019 ve been asking Senate Democrats what leverage they have on immigration given that they can no longer shut down the government . The answer , universally , is what leverage exists comes from the issue itself . DREAMers are popular , and deporting them is unpopular . But Donald Trump is the president of the United States , Mitch McConnell is the majority leader of the US Senate , and Paul Ryan is the speaker of the House . They control the process , and they control the outcome .",

        "content": "An eight-year-old boy from Guatemala has died in US government custody , officials say , the second migrant child to die in US detention this month .\nThe border agency says the boy died on Monday night hours after showing signs of illness . A Texas congressman named him as Felipe Al\u00f3nzo-Gomez .\nThe child was detained with his father on 18 December after illegally crossing the US-Mexico border .\nA seven-year-old girl died earlier this month just hours after being detained .\nJakelin Caal , also from Guatemala , developed a high fever and died of liver failure . Her funeral was held in her village on Tuesday .\nThousands of migrants have travelled from Central America - mainly from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador - to the US border .\nMany say they are fleeing persecution , poverty and violence in their home countries and plan to seek asylum in the US .\nIn a new , lengthy statement , the US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) said the boy , whose identity has not been officially confirmed , died at 23:48 local time ( 06:48 GMT ) on 24 December . The cause of death is still unknown .\nAfter being detained in El Paso , Texas , he and his father were taken to a local processing centre , where they spent two days . They were then sent to El Paso Border Patrol Station , where they were held for another two days .\nOn 22 December , they were transferred to Alamogordo Border Patrol Station , in neighbouring New Mexico .\nOn Monday morning , an agent noticed that the boy `` was coughing and appeared to have glossy eyes '' . He was taken with his father to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a common cold and given Tylenol ( paracetamol ) .\nWhile being evaluated for release , he was found to have a fever of 103F ( 39.4C ) and held for more observation . He was released shortly afterwards with a prescription for an antibiotic and ibuprofen .\nThe boy and his father were taken to a temporary site at the Highway 70 checkpoint , where the child received the medication . Two hours later , he vomited .\nHis father declined further medical assistance , the CBP said , as the child had been feeling better .\nThe child appeared lethargic at around 22:00 , when he was sent back to the hospital . While being transported , the boy vomited and lost consciousness , and doctors at the hospital were unable to revive him .\nThe CBP earlier said the boy died just after midnight . It did not explain why they were held for so long .\nHis father remains in custody . The Associated Press news agency reported they had plans to go to Johnson City , Tennessee .\nCBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the death was `` tragic '' and announced that the agency would conduct further medical checks on all children in custody , with a focus on those under the age of 10 .\nHe also said the CBP would review its policies and work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) to improve custody conditions .\nHuman rights groups criticised the CBP and Guatemala 's foreign ministry called for an investigation .\nTexas Congressman Joaquin Castro called for a congressional investigation , saying the administration 's policy of turning people away at the border `` is putting families and children in great danger '' .\nThe Trump administration has tried to deter asylum seekers from crossing the border irregularly between ports of entry , warning that they could face arrest , prosecution and deportation .\nBut , at the same time , it is restricting access to those trying to cross through official ports of entry , creating a long wait for applicants .\nAmong them are thousands of Central American migrants who travelled together in so-called `` caravans '' , and arrived at the border with California in recent weeks .\nPresident Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases .",

        "topic": "Trump racks up wins in battle to contain surge at border",
        "date": "2019-07-28",
        "content": "President Trump is suddenly on a surprising winning streak when it comes to immigration .\nWith his border wall , where the Supreme Court has cleared the way to begin construction under his emergency declaration , and negotiations with Latin American neighbors , Mr. Trump in the past weeks has finally begun to make headway on a number of major items on his immigration checklist .\nThe court and foreign policy victories were coupled with some policy moves within the administration that could further constrain the surge of migrants , including guidance issued Friday telling asylum officers to make sure migrants are fleeing state-sanctioned violence before they are granted asylum .\n\u201c The Trump administration is trying to throw everything it can at this problem , \u201d said Jessica Vaughan , policy studies director at the Center for Immigration Studies .\nThe big moves last week included an agreement signed with Guatemala that will allow the U.S. to send any asylum-seekers who cross that country \u2019 s territory en route to the U.S. back to Guatemala to ask for asylum there instead .\nGiven Guatemala \u2019 s strategic geographic location \u2014 it lies on Mexico \u2019 s southern border , and land travelers must cross it during their journey north \u2014 the agreement could allow the U.S. to deny tens of thousands of asylum-seekers the chance to ask for status before they reach the border .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve long been working with Guatemala , and now we can do it the right way , \u201d Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office after signing the deal with Guatemalan Interior Minister Enrique Degenhart .\nHours later , the president received news of another win : The Supreme Court , in a 5-4 ruling , had cleared the way for him to use his emergency border declaration to use Pentagon money to build more of his wall .\nThe Republican-appointed justices ended a lower-court blockade of his budgeting moves , limits that a federal district judge in California and later an appeals court had imposed while the case was being argued on the merits .\nThe high court didn \u2019 t reveal its reasoning , but the ruling is a major victory at a crucial time .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s attorneys told the justices they were racing a Sept. 30 deadline . If they didn \u2019 t obligate the money by then , they would lose the chance to spend it on the wall .\nThe immediate effect of the ruling is to let the administration tap several billion dollars within the Pentagon \u2019 s budget and direct it toward building the wall , which was Mr. Trump \u2019 s most visible 2016 campaign promise .\nOpponents said they will continue to fight , including pressing lower courts to speed up the arguments on their broader challenge to the emergency declaration \u2019 s constitutionality .\n\u201c This is not over , \u201d said Dror Ladin , an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , said the Supreme Court ruling \u201c undermines the Constitution . \u201d\nMr. Trump expressed his enthusiasm in his unique system of uppercase letters on Twitter : \u201c Big WIN for Border Security and the Rule of Law ! \u201d\nThe two victories for Mr. Trump last week follow on his success in June , when he used the threat of tariffs to force Mexico to the bargaining table . Mexico agreed to do more to head off migrants crossing its territory and to take back more Central American asylum-seekers , making them wait in Mexico while their cases proceed through the U.S. immigration courts .\nThe effects of the Mexico deal were already having some effect .\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan told \u201c Fox Business Sunday \u201d that the number of illegal immigrants nabbed at the U.S.-Mexico border fell 28 % in June and is down another 20 % in July .\nIn May , Customs and Border Protection encountered 4,650 unauthorized migrants a day . The number now is 2,600 , he said .\nThe emergency border spending bill that Mr. Trump won from Congress a month ago has also helped ease overcrowding at border facilities .\nAt its peak in early June , CBP had 19,000 people in custody . That number is now 7,200 , Mr. McAleenan said .\nOne of Mr. McAleenan \u2019 s top lieutenants took yet another step Friday to try to reduce the flow of migrants by ordering asylum officers to cast a dim eye on some asylum claims .\n\u201c Private violence \u201d doesn \u2019 t cut it , said Ken Cuccinelli , acting director of U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services . While conditions may be rough , he said , there just isn \u2019 t enough \u201c pervasive \u201d violence in El Salvador , Honduras and Guatemala to automatically grant asylum to people fleeing those countries .\nMr. Trump started winning immigration fights after he revamped his team , shuffling the leaders of the Homeland Security Department and each of the three agencies that handles immigration . The department and all three agencies are now headed by temporary officers .\nThe administration \u2019 s moves will continue to face scrutiny in the courts .\nSeveral activist groups have vowed to challenge the Guatemala asylum agreement . Critics said that country isn \u2019 t safe enough nor capable enough to provide asylum to others crossing its territory .\n\u201c Such an arrangement would make a mockery of the notion that those fleeing persecution in Central America have any recourse , \u201d said Eric Schwartz , president of Refugees International .\nMs. Vaughan , though , said the Guatemala agreement was proof that the U.S. does have leverage with foreign countries that previous administrations hadn \u2019 t used .\n\u201c What remains to be seen is which message comes through stronger in Central America ( and around the world now ) \u2014 do they hear that the risk of failure is much higher now because Trump and the other governments are cracking down , or do they hear that American judges are blocking his efforts ? \u201d she said .\nShe said the Trump administration must be prepared to fend off those legal challenges .\n\u201c Now that Trump has come to realize that Congress isn \u2019 t going to be much help , and that he needs to go at this problem from all angles , with every immigration agency involved , it looks like we are finally starting to see results , \u201d she said .",

        "content": "Fazliddin Kurbanov is from Uzbekistan , a Central Asian country that borders Afghanistan . This month , Mr. Kurbanov was arrested in Boise , Idaho , charged with teaching people how to build bombs that could be used to target public transportation . He is accused of conspiring with the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Mr. Kurbanov was here legally , admitted as a refugee in 2009 .\nLast year , in Aurora , Colo. , Jamshid Muhtorov was arrested and charged with providing material support to the Islamic Jihad Union , which the United States recognizes as a terrorist organization . Like Mr. Kurbanov , Mr. Muhtorov is from Uzbekistan and was also here legally as a refugee .\nIn 2011 , in my hometown of Bowling Green , Ky. , Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi were arrested and accused of supporting efforts to kill American troops in Iraq . Both men are from Iraq . Both were also here legally as refugees .\nThe Bowling Green Daily News reported that these Iraqi refugees \u201c slipped through the vetting process that allowed both of them political asylum in the United States. \u201d Apparently , Mr. Kurbanov and Mr. Muhtorov \u201c slipped through \u201d as well .\nSo did Ulugbek Kodirov , who was arrested in Birmingham , Ala. , last year and sentenced to 15 years in prison for plotting to kill President Obama . Kodirov was from Uzbekistan and was in the country illegally on a student-visa overstay .\nLast month , two pressure-cooker bombs were exploded near the finish line of the Boston Marathon , killing three and injuring 264 people . The Washington Post noted of the suspects , brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev : \u201c With their baseball hats and sauntering gaits , they appeared to friends and neighbors like ordinary American boys . But the Boston bombing suspects were refugees from another world \u2014 the blood , rubble and dirty wars of the Russian Caucasus . \u201d\nI condemn government inefficiency and incompetence often . The targets for criticism are endless . In the repeating patterns from these refugee and visa cases , however , we see potentially dangerous scenarios in which we can not afford any excuses .\nIn the case of Sept. 11 , 2001 , if the State Department had more adequately monitored visa overstays and application screening , most of hijackers would have been detected and caught beforehand . After the Boston bombing , I asked what faults we might have in our current intelligence that allowed the Russian government to identify the suspects as potential terrorists before the US government did .\nThese questions are crucial as Congress continues to debate immigration reform , in which vital national security concerns must be addressed . Our visa and refugee programs deserve far more monitoring and scrutiny , and there is something desperately wrong with a \u201c vetting process \u201d that makes so many repeated mistakes .\nNot all countries are the same , and neither are refugees . The National Security Registration System created by Congress in 2002 was intended to give extra screening to those coming from countries with higher populations of extremists . Suspended in 2011 , to my knowledge , there has been no effort to replace it with similar screening . There \u2019 s really no excuse for this . We send men and women all over the world to fight terrorism and often seem unwilling to take the most common-sense precautions at home with our immigration policies . We know that the old system had its problems , but we also know that what we \u2019 re doing now isn \u2019 t working .\nIt is ironic that some of the things we call \u201c national security \u201d in our foreign policy actually have little to do with protecting the nation , while some of the simple things we don \u2019 t do in our immigration policy could better protect us . It \u2019 s time we did them .\nAfter the tragic attack in Boston , I sent the following in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid :\n\u201c I respectfully request that the Senate consider the following two conditions as part of the comprehensive immigration-reform debate : One , the Senate needs a thorough examination of the facts in Massachusetts to see if legislation is necessary to prevent a similar situation in the future . Two , national security protections must be rolled into comprehensive immigration reform to make sure the federal government does everything it can to prevent immigrants with malicious intent from using our immigration system to gain entry into the United States in order to commit future acts of terror . \u201d\nMy proposed amendments to immigration-reform legislation seek to correct flaws in our current system , and these weaknesses must be addressed before any genuine reform can happen .\nThey must also be addressed before another attack or tragedy happens \u2014 and it is our job in Congress to address them .\nSen. Rand Paul , Kentucky Republican , is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Homeland Security committees .",

        "content": "Assaults on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents reached a decade high in 2017 , and assaults on Border Patrol agents also have surged in recent years , according to government numbers that seem to support agents \u2019 claims that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally increasingly are looking to fight rather than flee .\nThe new numbers , reported by Homeland Security \u2019 s inspector general , could even be underselling the problem , investigators said , because the government doesn \u2019 t do a good job of tracking incidents , and agents and officers don \u2019 t always report them properly .\nBut the report does signal renewed danger particularly on the southwest border , where agents say a surge in illegal immigration in recent years generally correlates with growing violence .\nProsecutors , meanwhile , often refuse to bring charges or win cases against the perpetrators , the audit found .\nAt the border , the most frequent method of attack was projectiles \u2014 usually large rocks \u2014 which accounted for half of assaults . But bombs , clubs , knives , guns and even laser pointers to blind agents have all been used .\nMost of the injuries were minor and didn \u2019 t require treatment , the audit found .\nCustoms and Border Protection recorded 1,089 assaults in 2010 , which steadily dropped through 2014 , when there were just 381 assaults . But things turned violent once again , steadily rising to 856 assaults in 2017 .\nLast year was the most violent this decade at the border , with 28 assaults per every 10,000 apprehensions .\nIn the interior , meanwhile , ICE agents and officers saw 48 assaults in 2017 , tying 2010 as the highest in records going back to the beginning of the decade .\nICE officers , who handle deportations , and Border Patrol agents , who patrol the line between the U.S. and Mexico , say they \u2019 ve seen an increasing willingness on the part of migrants to resort to violence in recent years .\nOne of those assaults recorded in 2017 came when ICE officers tried to apprehend Lester Sadict Cruz-Garcia , an immigrant from Honduras who was arrested by police in New York on a domestic assault charge . Police released him into the community , ignoring a request by ICE that he be held .\nDeportation officers then had to go out into the community to track him down at his home . When they approached him , he struggled and kicked , attempting the get away , the officers said .\nThey eventually got him in handcuffs and tried to get him into the back of an ICE vehicle when he bit one of the officers on the arm . The officer was taken to a hospital , where he was prescribed antibiotics .\nCruz-Garcia was sentenced in June to 364 days in jail .\nIn another incident last year , ICE officers in Massachusetts were trying to deport Mohammed Kenneh to Liberia . They drove him to Logan International Airport in Boston , but he knocked one officer to the ground and then used the handcuffs around his wrists to ensnare the officer \u2019 s hand , refusing to let go .\nThe officer had to be taken to the emergency room .",

        "content": "Law enforcement in San Francisco will no longer be cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , per a directive by San Francisco \u2019 s newly elected sheriff .\nPaul Miyamoto , who was elected to be the top law enforcer in San Francisco in November 2019 , declared to a local media outlet Tuesday that his department will not help with federal immigration enforcement . While San Francisco has long opposed most cooperation with ICE , the announcement further cements the progressive city \u2019 s status as a sanctuary jurisdiction .\n\u201c Our department is not involved in immigration enforcement , \u201d Miyamoto , the first Asian American sheriff of San Francisco , told KTVU Fox 2 . \u201c We feel that is a federal matter , and our realm of interest is public safety , and you can \u2019 t really have a safe community if the community members are afraid to come to us to report crimes . \u201d\nNamely , his department will not honor immigration detainers lodged by federal agents . If an illegal alien in San Francisco is placed into local custody for an unrelated crime , and ICE asks that the individual be transferred into the agency \u2019 s custody , that request will simply be ignored .\nMiyamoto argues that the policy promotes public safety , despite that there are many documented cases of illegal aliens committing additional crimes after they have been released from local custody .\nThe directive appears somewhat redundant given that authorities all across California have already been greatly prohibited in how they can work with ICE . Having been in effect since January 2018 , the California Values Act bars state and local agencies from honoring ICE detainer requests , making it impossible for illegal aliens to be directly transferred into the agency \u2019 s custody .\nWhile giving his latest State of the Union address earlier in February , President Donald Trump specifically highlighted California as an example of the dangers of sanctuary policy . The president invited as his guest the brother of a man who was killed by an illegal alien . That particular alien had been arrested by local authorities and had an ICE detainer placed on him , but because of the California Values Act law , he was released back into the public .\nThe Trump administration took its opposition to California \u2019 s sanctuary policies a monumental step farther this month when the Department of Justice announced a complaint against a state law that prohibits the operation of private detention facilities . Attorney General William Barr said at the time that the law was intended to forbid the detention of aliens in the state .\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed , a Democrat , declared that the city was being unfairly targeted by the Trump administration , but she remained adamant about the city \u2019 s protection of illegal aliens . ( RELATED : \u2018 Endangers The Lives Of The Public \u2019 : Trump Goes On Rant About Los Angeles Mayor )\n\u201c We \u2019 re being targeted on so many levels , \u201d Breed said . \u201c But , the fact is we \u2019 re a strong city , we \u2019 re a resilient city and we will fight against those attacks and we will protect the people of this city . \u201d",

        "content": "The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced amendments Tuesday to grant gay couples the same immigration rights as other married couples , setting up a key hurdle for the immigration bill .\nAmendments were due Tuesday if they were to be part of the debate that begins Thursday in the Judiciary Committee . The dozens of changes filed by senators signal a bloody fight ahead as some Democrats seek to make the bill more generous , some Republicans seek a deeper crackdown , and the legislation \u2019 s sponsors try to hold a tenuous center .\nSen. Jeff Sessions , an Alabama Republican who has taken the lead in fighting to stop the bill , introduced 49 amendments , including limiting the overall level of legal immigration allowed under the bill , or requiring the full 700 miles of reinforced fencing Congress called for back in 2006 , but which was only partially built .\nAnd Sen. Chuck Grassley , the ranking Republican on the committee , introduced 77 amendments .\nThe gay rights fight already is getting attention as a major sticking point because it will put majority Democrats on the spot .\nSen. Patrick J. Leahy , the committee chairman , introduced two different versions : One would apply to \u201c permanent partners , \u201d which critics said could invite widespread fraud . The other would only apply to same-sex couples who are legally married , which given the laws in various states would dramatically limit who could qualify .\nSEE ALSO : Report : Legalizing illegal immigrants to cost $ 6.3 trillion\n\u201c For immigration reform to be truly comprehensive , it must include protections for all families , \u201d the Vermont Democrat said . \u201c We must end the discrimination that gay and lesbian families face in our immigration law . \u201d\nHis amendment , though , will test Democrats who want to see a bill pass but also want to expand it .\nThe eight senators \u2014 four Democrats and four Republicans \u2014 who wrote the bill now must decide how they will approach the amendments .\nIn 2007 , the last time the Senate debated a bill , the sponsors had a deal to oppose all major amendments and to try to keep the basic agreement intact . But that tactic failed as Democrats attached an amendment limiting the size of a future guest-worker program . The bill collapsed under opposition from both ends of the political spectrum .\nAs of Tuesday evening , the Judiciary Committee had posted 130 amendments from six members of the committee \u2014 and that didn \u2019 t include Mr. Sessions \u2019 49 amendments , nor those of 11 other committee members .\nThe sheer weight of those amendments presages a long fight in committee before the bill even reaches the floor .\nRepublicans still felt the entire debate was rushed , given that the final version of the main 867-page bill was introduced just last week .\n\u201c Unfortunately , members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have had less time to review this nearly 1,000-page bill than the special interests who wrote it behind closed doors , \u201d Mr . Sessions said .\nHe said the bill falls short of the promises its sponsors made to build a border fence , to have illegal immigrants pay back taxes and to prevent them from gaining public benefits .\nThe crux of the Senate bill is a deal to offer illegal immigrants quick legal status , but to withhold a full pathway to citizenship until the Homeland Security Department makes strides on border security and interior enforcement .",

        "date": "2017-02-11",
        "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s deportation force promise may be coming true .\nOver the last five days , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agents conducted what they call an \u201c enforcement surge \u201d in the Los Angeles area , arresting more than 160 undocumented immigrants . Immigrants \u2019 rights groups and lawyers told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that ICE also increased its enforcement activities\u2014including , in some cases , in apartment buildings\u2014in a number of cities around the country , including Atlanta , Phoenix , Charlotte , and Austin .\nICE officials and the White House say this is normal . Activists , lawyers , and members of Congress say it \u2019 s a major change\u2014and likely just the beginning .\n\u201c The muscle to do this kind of stuff is here\u2014it \u2019 s just that the leash has been taken off , \u201d said Sarah Owings , an immigration attorney in Atlanta . \u201c They \u2019 re out and they \u2019 re hunting . \u201d\nOwings said upward of 40 undocumented immigrants have been detained in the Savanna , Georgia , area over the last two days , according to the family of an undocumented immigrant currently detained there . And she said she knows of two apartment complexes with high concentrations of Latino residents where ICE officers went door-to-door looking for specific individuals . When people opened their doors , Owings said , the ICE officers would ask everyone present to show proof that they were in the United States legally .\n\u201c They \u2019 re picking up and rounding up anyone they can get , \u201d she said .\nIn a statement , an ICE spokesperson criticized recent media coverage of the Los Angeles apprehensions .\n\u201c The rash of recent reports about purported ICE checkpoints and random sweeps are false , dangerous , and irresponsible , \u201d the spokesperson said . \u201c These reports create panic and put communities and law enforcement personnel in unnecessary danger . Individuals who falsely report such activities are doing a disservice to those they claim to support . \u201d\nOn Feb. 9 , an ICE official told reporters on background that reports the agency arrested 100 people in the Los Angeles area that day were \u201c grossly exaggerated. \u201d Virginia Kice , an ICE spokesperson , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 there were 38 arrests in the L.A. area that day .\nKice and Michael Short , a White House senior assistant press secretary , both told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the enforcement activities were routine .\nMany immigration activists and Capitol Hill Democrats say they doubt that . Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva , a Democrat from Arizona , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that among his conference , there \u2019 s \u201c not much \u201d confidence in the agency \u2019 s statements . And Bob Libal , the executive director of Grassroots Leadership\u2014a group based in Austin that opposes immigrant detention and deportation\u2014said he suspected the agency may have targeted Austin because of frustration over the county sheriff \u2019 s recently announced refusal to comply with ICE \u2019 s detainer requests .\nLibal said his group estimates that about two dozen undocumented immigrants have been arrested by ICE agents on Feb. 9 and 10 .\n\u201c We have a deportation defense hotline and it \u2019 s ringing off the hook , \u201d he said .\nHe added that he wasn \u2019 t aware of a time in recent memory when that many undocumented immigrants were arrested in Austin in such a short period of time .\n\u201c This is a level of intimidation that seems new , \u201d he said . \u201c And our community is not going to be intimidated .\n\u201c It very much feels retaliatory , \u201d he added . \u201c It feels like a vicious attack . \u201d\nGrijalva said he thought the enforcement surge may be a response to Trump \u2019 s recent defeat in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , where a three-judge panel moved unanimously to block enforcement of his travel ban .\n\u201c Every time he gets hit politically , like in the 9th Circuit , his reaction is to go back to that mantra and use it and use it , \u201d Grijalva said , of Trump \u2019 s anti-immigrant rhetoric during the campaign . \u201c Except now it \u2019 s not campaign rhetoric .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a conspiracy-theory person , \u201d he added . \u201c But it walks like a duck . It \u2019 s got ta be a duck . \u201d\n\u201c They are routine , enforcement operations targeting criminals , \u201d Short said . \u201c Rep . Grijalva \u2019 s comments couldn \u2019 t be further from the truth . \u201d\nKice said ICE \u2019 s enforcement activities are motivated solely by public safety and law enforcement concerns .\n\u201c Our enforcement operations are lead-driven and they are targeted , \u201d she said .\nAnd David Marin , who helps head ICE \u2019 s Los Angeles field office , told reporters on a conference call on Friday evening that the L.A. enforcement activity was \u201c nothing out of the ordinary . \u201d\n\u201c These are targeted enforcement operations , nothing different than what we \u2019 ve been doing for the past five , six , seven years , \u201d he said .\nImmigration activists point to one of Trump \u2019 s first executive orders as the impetus behind the enforcement surge . In a blog post , Azadeh Erfani of the Capital Area Immigrants \u2019 Rights Coalition wrote that the president \u2019 s Jan. 25 executive order titled \u201c Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States \u201d made upward of 8 million undocumented immigrants top priorities for deportation .\n\u201c Our immigrant community likely will experience the paradox of being both at the margins of society and the target of law enforcement , \u201d Erfani wrote .\nTrump hasn \u2019 t kept all his immigration-crackdown campaign promises ; despite making it a key campaign issue , the president has yet to undo the temporary deportation protections that President Barack Obama made available to undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children .\nA staffer for a Democratic congressional office that frequently criticized the Obama administration \u2019 s immigration enforcement practices said the week \u2019 s enforcement uptick was uniquely concerning . He said that though the ICE conducted raids that resulted in dozens of arrests during Obama \u2019 s presidency , this particular surge worries activists because it \u2019 s happening in so many cities around the country at the same time and in the wake of Trump \u2019 s executive order . Some Hill Democrats worry this could be the new normal , he added .\n\u201c It will happen until the beds are full , \u201d she said . \u201c They \u2019 ll have to stop at some point , right ? \u201d",

        "date": "2016-04-17",
        "content": "If this president is allowed to reinterpret the law , what about the next one ?\nSometimes it seems the Supreme Court \u2019 s main purpose these days is to resolve disputes between Republicans and President Obama .\nToward the end of Obama \u2019 s first term , the court ruled on a challenge to his signature health care law . On Monday , as Obama approaches the end of his second term , the justices are set to consider his executive order that would allow millions of undocumented workers to avoid deportation .\nObama won the first of these cases . The court ruled , correctly in our view , that Obamacare 's insurance mandate did not violate the Constitution . The president 's backers hope and believe that the court will take a similar tack in U.S. v. Texas , finding that the case is a political squabble dressed up as a legal dispute .\nTo be sure , Obama \u2019 s quest to reform the immigration system is a worthy cause . Keeping millions of undocumented immigrants in a state of legal limbo makes little sense .\nLike his predecessor , George W. Bush , Obama backed legislation to grant these immigrants a path to legal status while beefing up border enforcement and making needed changes to the legal immigration system . That legislation passed with bipartisan support in the Senate but ran into a buzz saw of opposition from conservatives in the House .\nFaced with legislative gridlock , the president acted unilaterally . Obama \u2019 s 2014 order , known as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans , combined with a predecessor order he issued two years earlier , would allow as many as 5 million of the estimated 11 million undocumented people to remain in the United States without fear of deportation .\nWhile courts have typically given great deference to presidents in matters of immigration , this is simply too sweeping a policy change to exclude the legislative branch . It does the right thing in the wrong way .\nThe order has many flaws . Because it could be rescinded by a future president , it would not give immigrants the certainty they 'd need to come out from the shadows and fully participate in their communities . Because it addresses only undocumented workers , it would do nothing for backlogs in legal immigration and a shortage of skilled workers .\nThe order 's biggest flaw , however , is the precedent it would set by giving the president sweeping authority to interpret immigration laws virtually any way he or she sees fit . The same people who think Obama should have broad powers over immigration enforcement will feel a lot differently if a Republican wins the White House in November .\nImagine what orders Ted Cruz or Donald Trump would issue if elected president . Trump has advocated mass deportations , temporarily banning entry of foreign Muslims , and building a border wall financed by confiscating the remittances that undocumented workers attempt to send to their families back home .\nIn an interview with NBC News this year , Trump said he would n't hesitate to issue executive orders , noting that Obama had \u201c led the way \u201d with his actions .\nThe court would be wise to limit the president 's authority in this area , and leave Congress and the White House to work out through the legislative process how to handle undocumented immigrants , as maddening as that might be .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff .

        "content": "Democrats dug in their heels Sunday on President Trump \u2019 s threat to shut down the government unless he gets money for his border wall , saying if the president makes good on his demand , the American people will suffer .\nBut the White House contends American citizens are already suffering \u2014 with or without a shutdown \u2014 because of the rise in illegal immigration .\nThe two sides showed no sign of willingness to compromise Sunday , with just four days left to broker an agreement before the federal government partially shuts down .\n\u201c We should not let a temper tantrum \u2014 threats \u2014 push us in the direction of doing something even our Republican colleagues know is wrong , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer told NBC .\nThe New York Democrat said Republicans in Congress \u201c have to have the guts \u201d to tell the president he \u2019 s wrong for refusing to fund the government unless he gets $ 5 billion for his border wall .\n\u201c President Trump should understand there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate . He is not going to get the wall in any form , \u201d he said .\nAnd the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Rep. Elijah Cummings , Maryland Democrat , said voters want the government to help them , not hurt them , suggesting a shutdown will politically damage Republicans .\n\u201c Whenever I hear a president say to the American people at Christmastime , \u2018 I am going to shut down your government , \u2019 it pains me because I know it \u2019 s going to make a bad Christmas for a lot of people , \u201d he told CNN .\nBut White House adviser Stephen Miller said Mr. Trump will do \u201c whatever is necessary \u201d to get the money to build the border wall .\n\u201c They can either choose to fight for Americans \u2014 working class \u2014 or to promote illegal immigration . You can \u2019 t do both , \u201d Mr. Miller said of Democrats in an interview Sunday with CBS .\nCongress is running up against a Friday deadline to finish funding the government , with several news reports suggesting they may look to a short-term \u201c continuing resolution \u201d that funds the government at current levels to get them past the holidays and into the new year .\nSen. Susan Collins , Maine Republican , told ABC she wants to see lawmakers take up a proposal that provided $ 2.5 billion this year and over the next 10 years for border security , which would fund a border fence , increase technology and patrol agents along the southern border .\n\u201c There is absolutely no excuse to shut down government on this issue or any issue . I have suggested we revisit a compromise proposal we brought forward earlier this year , \u201d she said on Sunday , breaking with her party \u2019 s leader .\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Mr. Schumer have offered Mr. Trump two other options , and they both include some money \u2014 roughly $ 1.3 billion \u2014 for the wall .\nBut it remains unclear whether the president will accept any compromise after his televised stand off with the two Democratic leaders in the Oval Office last week , where he demanded the $ 5 billion and claimed he isn \u2019 t afraid to shut down the government .\n\u201c I am proud to shut down the government for border security , \u201d Mr. Trump said .",

        "date": "2013-06-27",
        "content": "Vowing that they have learned the lessons from the 1986 amnesty , the Senate on Thursday approved the biggest changes to the immigration system in a generation , promising this version will prevent another wave of illegal immigrants while granting a pathway to citizenship to most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country .\nThe 68-32 vote , in which 14 Republicans joined all 54 of the chamber \u2019 s Democratic caucus members in support , is likely the high-water mark for immigrant rights advocates , who held prayer vigils and packed the public viewing galleries during the vote , anticipating good news for illegal immigrants who have been waiting , in some cases for years , for legal status .\n\u201c This bill is not perfect , but it \u2019 s a really good solution , in my view , to a very difficult problem , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham , a South Carolina Republican who was part of the bipartisan \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d senators who wrote the bill and managed to fend off every major challenge to it .\nNow the fight shifts to the Republican-led House , where Speaker John A. Boehner once again insisted that the Senate bill is dead on arrival .\n\u201c The House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes , \u201d the Ohio Republican said flatly at his weekly news conference before attacking the Senate version as too weak on border security .\nInstead , Mr. Boehner seemed to sketch out a path that would put a series of smaller bills on the chamber floor , rather than the broad approach the Senate took , which mixes legal immigration , enforcement and the status of 11 million illegal immigrants into a 1,200-page bill .\nSEE ALSO : Senators \u2019 votes on immigration were linked to personal experiences\nSenate supporters of legalization said they hoped Mr. Boehner would rethink his strategy , though they fell just shy of the 70-vote threshold that they said would create the momentum to force the House to act .\nPresident Obama , traveling in Africa , issued a statement praising the Senate vote while warning that it still faces an uncertain future .\n\u201c Now is the time when opponents will try their hardest to pull this bipartisan effort apart so they can stop common-sense reform from becoming a reality , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c We can not let that happen . \u201d\nSen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , said other Republicans supported the bill but didn \u2019 t vote for it , though he didn \u2019 t say who they were . But he said getting to 68 was a major accomplishment .\n\u201c The day we announced this legislation , we were a long , long way from 68 votes , \u201d he said .\nHe and his fellow Gang of Eight members did a masterful job of holding together and expanding their coalition , in part by denying senators the chance to amend the bill .\nOf more than 550 amendments filed , only about a dozen were put to votes , and just one was a major change that passed .\nA last-minute effort to approve other changes failed when Republicans objected .\nSenators gave the final vote the full pomp of landmark legislation . Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , asked that senators vote from their desks \u2014 a formality reserved for the biggest issues , such as the 2009 vote on Mr. Obama \u2019 s health care act . Vice President Joseph R. Biden presided over the session and read out the final vote totals .\n\u201c It \u2019 s historic , \u201d said Mr. Reid , who is one of the chief reasons the legislation has advanced this year .\nIt was Mr. Reid \u2019 s re-election in 2010 and Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election in 2012 \u2014 both aided by strong Hispanic support \u2014 that helped put immigration back to the fore of the political conversation .\nSince Mr. Obama \u2019 s November victory , congressional Republicans have held a fierce internal debate over whether they need to pass a legalization bill in order to compete for Hispanic voters .\nThe crux of the Senate bill is a deal to offer quick legal status to illegal immigrants , but withhold full citizenship rights until some conditions are met . Backers said they didn \u2019 t want to repeat the experience of the 1986 immigration law , when millions of illegal immigrants were granted citizenship but the government never followed through on enforcement , leading to millions more illegal immigrants .\nThis time , they said , they would tie future citizenship rights to checking off boxes on border security .\nBut the key point of contention has been over how strict to make those conditions . Democrats have said they don \u2019 t want to do anything that would interfere with the path to citizenship , and they have succeeded in beating back amendments to make the citizenship path contingent on provable success . Instead , the Senate bill relies on measures of spending and having infrastructure and manpower in place .\nThe one major amendment that passed , proposed by Republican Sens . Bob Corker of Tennessee and John Hoeven of North Dakota , called for adding 20,000 Border Patrol agents to the Southwest and would push the Homeland Security Department to build an additional 350 miles of pedestrian fencing .\nMr. McCain said the staffing , infrastructure and technology are the guarantees he needs to be certain the failures of 1986 aren \u2019 t repeated .\n\u201c I can tell you from 30 years of being on the border , this bill secures the border , and anyone who says it doesn \u2019 t does not understand our security needs , \u201d the senator said .\nBut the National Border Patrol Council , which represents Border Patrol agents , said it had \u201c serious concerns \u201d about the boost in staffing .\n\u201c Unless we \u2019 re going to form a human chain from Brownsville to Imperial Beach , I \u2019 m not sure this is going to be the cure that everybody thinks it will be at the border , \u201d said Shawn Moran , a vice president at the council . \u201c We don \u2019 t have money for gas or ammunition or uniforms , and that \u2019 s at 21,000 agents . I \u2019 m not sure how we \u2019 re going to be able to handle 40,000 agents . I don \u2019 t know where we \u2019 re going to put them . \u201d\nThe council had a different proposal to reform agents \u2019 pay , which Mr. Moran said would have put more agents into the field and would have been the equivalent of a 5,000-agent boost over the course of a year . But that proposal got held up along with the hundreds of other amendments that never were put to a vote .\nIn addition to Mr. McCain , Mr. Corker , Mr. Graham and Mr. Hoeven , the Republicans supporting the legislation were Sens . Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , Jeff Chiesa of New Jersey , Susan M. Collins of Maine , Jeff Flake of Arizona , Orrin G. Hatch of Utah , Mark Kirk of Illinois , Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Marco Rubio of Florida .",

        "topic": "3 Things Blocking Immigration Reform in the House",
        "date": "",
        "content": "After a Senate committee passed the Gang of Eight immigration bill this week , audience members at the hearing chanted , `` S\u00ed se puede . '' That might not be the case once it 's the House of Representatives turn to take up immigration reform .\nSupporters of reform believe that the Democrat-controlled Senate will be much more willing to pass a bill with a pathway to citizenship than the GOP-controlled House . Any hope that the bipartisan Gang of Eight bill could quickly sail through both chambers was quashed on Thursday , when GOP leaders in the House said they would not simply take up and pass the legislation as is .\n`` The House remains committed to fixing our broken immigration system , but we will not simply take up and accept the bill that is emerging in the Senate if it passes , '' House Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) , Majority Leader Eric Cantor ( R-Va. ) , and other top lawmakers said in a joint statement . `` Rather , through regular order , the House will work its will and produce its own legislation . ''\nThat does n't necessarily mean that the immigration reform effort will die in the House , but there 's certainly an appetite to churn out a more conservative product . Whether the House can actually produce such a bill , and then square it with the Senate 's , remains to be seen .\nHere are three big reasons why immigration will be heavy lift in the House :\nEarlier this year , both Boehner and Cantor sounded optimistic tones on immigration reform . The duo had remained coy about how they will handle the issue , but their tone gave supporters hope that longstanding Republican opposition to a comprehensive bill had disappeared .\nThe reality is that Republican leadership is facing dueling tensions within their party . On one hand , party elites and political strategists see the writing on the wall : Republicans need to act on immigration reform in order to tap into the Hispanic and Asian-American electorate ( and actually have a shot at winning national elections ) .\nBut on the other hand , there 's a large group of conservative GOP lawmakers who are n't so fond of immigration reform , to put it mildly . In fact , there 's a good chance that a majority of House Republicans oppose legalizing immigrants in the country without authorization , since they think it amounts to `` amnesty . ''\nSo , leaders like Boehner and Cantor might see the long-term political logic behind bucking many in their conference and cooperating on immigration reform . But that decision would come with significant short-term political peril .\nFor every Paul Ryan , Sean Duffy and Ra\u00fal Labrador who want to compromise on immigration , there 's a Steve King , Louie Gohmert and Steve Stockman who will fight tooth and nail against it .\nThe latter trio is leading the opposition to immigration reform in the House . All three are known for making outlandish , and sometimes offensive , statements about immigration reform or immigrants .\nIn the 21st century , that would seem to marginalize a politician . But if King & Co. are able to foment conservative outrage against the bill , we could see a repeat of 2007 . Then , a similar bill was sunk by a revolt from talk-radio hosts , grassroots groups , and right-wing lawmakers .\nKing and other Republicans are already trying to compare immigration to President Obama 's healthcare law . And we all remember how conservatives reacted to that .\nThe House has its own bipartisan Gang of Eight , which has been meeting on and off for nearly four years to craft a comprehensive immigration reform bill .\nThe group of four Democrats and four Republicans announced they had reached a deal in principle last week . But that pronouncement now appears to have been made prematurely .\nPolitico reports that lawmakers agreed on a compromise over whether immigrants applying for citizenship should receive government-subsidized healthcare . But other significant issues remain unresolved , like provisions around border-security .\nIf the group is unable to agree on a comprehensive proposal , that could lead to a flood of bills that deal with immigration issues on a piecemeal basis . Some House Republicans prefer to tackle immigration issue-by-issue , but Senate leaders have called that approach a non-starter , fearing that a pathway to citizenship -- crucial for Democrats -- could be left aside .\nTheoretically , the Senate bill could be reconciled with a series of House bills . But judging by the level of dysfunction in Congress , that approach would have a slim chance of succeeding .\nBoehner may have summed it up best on Thursday , when he spoke to reporters at his weekly press conference .\n`` The House will work its will , '' he said . `` Do n't ask me how because if I knew I 'd certainly tell you .

        "content": "Chuck Schumer says some are using Boston as an excuse . Boston echoes in immigration debate\nThe fallout from the Boston bombings continues to complicate an already thorny congressional debate over reforming the nation \u2019 s immigration laws .\nOne week afterward , some Republican lawmakers and immigration reform critics pointed to the bombings as a reason to hit pause on reform . Democrats who have long championed reform accused Republicans of exploiting the attacks . And one senator briefly lost his temper at a colleague , clearly frustrated by accusations that he was trying to use the bombings to derail reform .\n\u201c I do not want to see comprehensive immigration reform fall victim to entrenched , partisan opposition , \u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D-Vt. ) said Monday . \u201c Let us continue to work together to make this bill better , rather than making sure that nothing can get done . \u201d\nBut opposition to moving the Gang of Eight \u2019 s immigration bill grew Monday , as Sen. Rand Paul ( R-Ky. ) wrote to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) that Congress \u201c should not proceed \u201d with immigration reform until lawmakers had a clearer picture of the Tsarnaev brothers \u2019 background .\nThe Tsarnaev brothers legally emigrated with their family to the United States as children , and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev \u2014 the younger brother who is hospitalized in serious condition \u2014 is a naturalized U.S. citizen , according to authorities . Tamerlan , who was killed early Friday during the massive citywide manhunt for the suspects , was a greencard holder .\n\u201c Why did the current system allow two individuals to [ emigrate ] to the United States from the Chechen Republic in Russia , an area known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism , who then committed acts of terrorism ? \u201d Paul asked Reid in his letter . \u201c Were there any safeguards ? Could this have been prevented ? Does the immigration reform before us address this ? \u201d\nMonday \u2019 s daylong hearing hosted more than 20 witnesses , including immigration activists , security experts , religious leaders and former elected officials . It was the second on immigration reform since the so-called Gang of Eight unveiled its bill last week .\nJanet Napolitano , secretary of Homeland Security , is scheduled to testify before the panel on Tuesday .\nSome witnesses urged lawmakers to train a more critical eye on immigration reform in light of the Boston attacks .\nMark Krikorian , the director of the Center for Immigration Studies , questioned whether the background checks required in the Senate legislation of undocumented immigrants to become legalized would be sufficient , considering an FBI investigation into Tamerlan Tsarnaev did not find any terrorist activity \u2014 domestic or foreign .\n\u201c The Boston bombing is not an excuse for delay of considering this immigration bill , but it is an illustration of certain problems that exist with our immigration system , \u201d testified Krikorian , whose group supports less immigration .\n\u201c The background checks in this bill are insufficient to prevent a terrorist from getting amnesty , \u201d added Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach , who helped draft Arizona \u2019 s strict immigration law .\nLeahy opened the hearing by denouncing reform critics \u2019 use of the Boston bombings as a way to slow down immigration reform , calling that tactic \u201c cruel . \u201d\n\u201c If you have ways to improve the bill , offer an amendment when we start markup in May and let \u2019 s vote on it , \u201d added Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , a key immigration negotiator . \u201c I say that particularly to those who are pointing to what happened , the terrible tragedy in Boston as \u2014 I would say excuse \u2014 for not doing a bill or to delaying it many months or years . \u201d",

        "topic": "Trump Ending Asylum Protections for Central Americans",
        "date": "2019-07-15",
        "content": "The Trump administration on Monday moved to end asylum protections for most Central American migrants in a major escalation of the president 's battle to tamp down the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border .\nAccording to a new rule published in the Federal Register , asylum seekers who pass through another country first will be ineligible for asylum at the U.S. southern border . The rule , expected to go into effect on Tuesday , also applies to children who have crossed the border alone .\nThere are some exceptions : If someone has been trafficked , if the country the migrant passed through did not sign one of the major international treaties that govern how refugees are managed ( though most Western countries have signed them ) or if an asylum-seeker sought protection in a country but was denied , then a migrant could still apply for U.S. asylum .\nBut the move by President Donald Trump 's administration was meant to essentially end asylum protections as they now are on the southern border .\nThe policy is almost certain to face a legal challenge . U.S. law allows refugees to request asylum when they arrive at the U.S. regardless of how they did so , but there is an exception for those who have come through a country considered to be `` safe . '' But the Immigration and Nationality Act , which governs asylum law , is vague on how a country is determined `` safe '' ; it says `` pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral agreement . ''\nRight now , the U.S. has such an agreement , known as a `` safe third country , '' only with Canada . Under a recent agreement with Mexico , Central American countries were considering a regional compact on the issue , but nothing has been decided . Guatemalan officials were expected in Washington on Monday , but apparently a meeting between Trump and Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales was canceled amid a court challenge in Guatemala over whether the country could agree to a safe third with the U.S .\nThe new rule also will apply to the initial asylum screening , known as a `` credible fear '' interview , at which migrants must prove they have credible fears of returning to their home country . It applies to migrants who are arriving to the U.S. , not those who are already in the country .\nTrump administration officials say the changes are meant to close the gap between the initial asylum screening that most people pass and the final decision on asylum that most people do not win . But immigrant rights groups , religious leaders and humanitarian groups have said the Republican administration 's policies amount to a cruel and calloused effort to keep immigrants out of the country . Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador are poor countries suffering from violence .\nAlong with the administration 's recent effort to send asylum seekers back over the border , Trump has tried to deny asylum to anyone crossing the border illegally and restrict who can claim asylum , and Attorney General William Barr recently tried to keep thousands of asylum seekers detained while their cases play out .\nNearly all of those efforts have been blocked by courts .\nMeanwhile , conditions have worsened for migrants who make it over the border seeking better lives . Tens of thousands of Central American migrant families cross the border each month , many claiming asylum . The numbers have increased despite Trump 's derisive rhetoric and hard-line immigration policies . Border facilities have been dangerously cramped and crowded well beyond capacity . The Department of Homeland Security 's watchdog found fetid , filthy conditions for many children . And lawmakers who traveled there recently decried conditions .\nImmigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases , meaning many people wo n't have their asylum claims heard for years despite move judges being hired .\nPeople are generally eligible for asylum in the U.S. if they feared return to their home country because they would be persecuted based on race , religion , nationality or membership in a particular social group .\nDuring the budget year for 2009 , there were 35,811 asylum claims , and 8,384 were granted . During 2018 budget year , there were 162,060 claims filed , and 13,168 were granted .",

        "topic": "Obama to Announce Executive Actions on Immigration",
        "date": "",
        "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Barack Obama will lay out sweeping changes to the immigration system in a speech Thursday night , offering new protections to millions of people in the country illegally and sparking a bitter fight with Republicans .\nThe executive action is expected to shield as many as five million illegal immigrants from deportation and offer them a chance for work permits , while overhauling the enforcement system and boosting border security , people briefed on the plan said . It would represent the most significant changes to U.S. immigration policy in nearly three decades , though it would fall far short of the comprehensive legislation supporters have been trying to pass since the George W. Bush administration .\nGOP reaction was swift and sharply negative , with Republicans saying the president is overstepping his authority , refusing to work with Congress and ignoring the will of voters , who this month delivered the GOP control of both houses of Congress . The White House cast the issue as an urgent policy priority .\n\u201c Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken . Unfortunately , Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a video released on the White House \u2019 s Facebook page Wednesday afternoon . He said he would use his authority to \u201c make the system work better . \u201d\nThe moves , and the GOP response , will likely extinguish an already dim chance of legislative action on immigration . Republican leaders , buoyed by their Senate win and stronger hold on the House after the midterms , warned that cooperation on other matters would be more difficult , as well .\n\u201c Sticking your finger in the eye of a recently elected Republican Congress is about as bad a way as I can think of to start off the last two years of what could be a productive term , \u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R. , Tenn. ) .\nAs an executive action , Mr. Obama \u2019 s policy could be overturned by a future president , though it could prove politically complicated to strip people of protected status once they have it .\nPresident Obama is also expected to make a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Friday . European Pressphoto Agency\nRepublicans were debating among themselves how to counter the president \u2019 s move . Some GOP lawmakers were pushing leaders to write limits on Mr. Obama into legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 to keep the government funded\u2014a course sure to draw a presidential veto threat and raise the prospect of a partial government shutdown . Others in the GOP counseled a less confrontational path .\nOptions being discussed include passing GOP-stamped immigration bills , passing stand-alone legislation next year to block Mr. Obama \u2019 s action and filing suit against the president , hoping a judge would intervene .\nMr. Obama is scheduled to lay out his policy in a speech to the nation Thursday at 8 p.m. EST , and then on Friday at a Las Vegas high school . It is the same school where the president , in a speech in early 2013 , laid out principles for immigration legislation that later passed the Democrat-led Senate but died in the GOP-controlled House .\nMr. Obama got immediate backup from his party . \u201c We have waited long enough for House Republicans . Since they won \u2019 t act , the president should , and he will , \u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) said on the Senate floor Wednesday .\nUnder the new policy , undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents who have been in the U.S. for at least five years would win a temporary stay of deportation and be eligible for work permits , according to several people briefed , including several Democratic lawmakers briefed by Mr. Obama over dinner Wednesday at the White House .\nRep. Joe Crowley ( D. , N.Y. ) , one of those briefed , said that the new policy is expected to benefit between 4 million and 5 million undocumented residents . Another congressman at the dinner said the figure would approach 5 million . Another person familiar with the plan said about 4 million would be eligible because of their family ties and longevity , and up to a million more through other provisions .\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan ( D. , N.M. ) said that to be eligible , people will have to undergo a background check , pay any back taxes and go through an application process . He added that the plan will also include stepped up border security .\nThe president is also expected to expand eligibility for a 2012 program that gives safe harbor from deportation to young people brought into the U.S. illegally as children , for instance by increasing the age limit for participation , people briefed on the plan said . This group , sometimes called Dreamers , has pressed Mr. Obama to use executive authority to protect illegal immigrants . But Mr. Obama wasn \u2019 t expected to extend protections to their parents , their top policy goal .\nAsked about the exclusion of Dreamer parents , Rep. Lujan said , \u201c The president is taking the action he is able to . This is a first step . \u201d\nMr. Obama told lawmakers that he didn \u2019 t want to halt his plans because some Republicans have raised the possibility of another government shutdown .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not running away from this because of the artificial deadlines that have been set up , \u201d Mr. Crowley said , explaining the president \u2019 s position .\nThe plan is also set to reorder immigration-enforcement priorities and revamp or replace the Secure Communities program , which uses local law enforcement to identify undocumented immigrants , one person briefed said . The person said it would also include a provision sought by businesses that would make it easier for students awaiting work visas to stay in the U.S .\nThe United Farm Workers estimated that at least 250,000 farm workers would be protected from deportation under criteria laid out for the union president , Arturo Rodriguez , in a meeting with Mr. Obama on Wednesday . The union estimates that there are about a million undocumented farm workers in the U.S. , though others put it lower .\nOne provision sought by businesses , particularly high-tech companies , isn \u2019 t in Mr. Obama \u2019 s package , several people said . It would have made available employment visas that were unused in previous years .\nA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , released Wednesday , found the president facing headwinds in laying out his policy , though public support for legalization of undocumented immigrants remains high .\nThe survey found 48 % of Americans disapprove of Mr. Obama \u2019 s acting without Congress on immigration , while 38 % approve . Even among Latinos , who overwhelmingly favor legalization for undocumented immigrants , 43 % say they approved of Mr. Obama acting alone , while 37 % didn \u2019 t .\nSupport for a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally remained robust , with 57 % of respondents favoring such a plan and 40 % opposing . Support grew to 74 % when people were given likely details of such a plan , including requirements illegal immigrants pay a fine and back taxes , and pass a security background check before qualifying for legal status .\n\u201c The public wants this policy , \u201d said Fred Yang , a Democratic pollster who co-directs the survey . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 ll be happy with how it might get done . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s course presents risks to both parties . For Mr. Obama , areas of agreement with Republicans in the remainder of his term\u2014such as trade promotion and an overhaul of the corporate tax code\u2014are sure to be more difficult , given the acrimony . Some Senate Republicans said they would be less inclined to approve his nominees .\nRep. Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) warned in an interview that Mr. Obama \u2019 s action would make agreement on a tax overhaul less likely . It \u201c would definitely hurt , that \u2019 s for sure , \u201d he said .\nOther Republicans worried an overheated response could backfire on the GOP . They said the party must show it can effectively govern\u2014a challenge , given that some in the party are urging a budget showdown to protest Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan . Others said the debate threatened efforts to improve the party \u2019 s shaky standing with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to have to control our response , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) . He said it was important that his party keep its criticism focused on perceived executive overreach and that Republicans not allow themselves to be cast as opposing immigration or immigrants .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very concerned that there will be loud voices in our party who have been complete demagogues on immigration , who have no solution , and people in my party will cater to them , \u201d Mr. Graham said .\nAnd Sen. Orrin Hatch ( R. , Utah ) said the responsibility for addressing immigration falls on both parties . \u201c We need to get off our duffs and solve this problem . \u201d\nNews of the president \u2019 s immigration plan reinforced a growing sense of partisan acrimony in Congress .\nOn Tuesday , the Senate narrowly defeated legislation approving the Keystone XL pipeline . The Senate then failed to advance a bill overhauling a National Security Agency program , likely ending efforts to address surveillance concerns this year .\nThe most immediate impact of the dispute will be on government funding after Dec. 11 . Lawmakers in both chambers have been working on omnibus legislation tying together 12 tailored spending bills that would fund the government through September 2015 , the end of the fiscal year . But GOP anger over the immigration action makes it harder to pass ambitious spending policy and more likely that Congress will simply extend the government \u2019 s current funding levels into early 2015 , said lawmakers and aides .\nOne route Republicans may pursue is to fund almost all of the government through September 2015 , but extend funding just until early next year for the agencies or programs that Mr. Obama would need to implement the executive action . Other options include passing Republican immigration bills , such as one beefing up border security , after the new Congress is sworn in .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been trying to figure out what leverage we have , and we \u2019 re finding it difficult to actually stop the president here in the next two months , \u201d said Rep. Marlin Stutzman ( R. , Ind. ) . \u201c We should pass our own immigration bills\u2014respond with conservative immigration policy that Republicans agree on . \u201d\n\u2014Colleen McCain Nelson , John D.
