        "content": "Registered nurse Asantewaa Boykin was volunteering as a medic in Sacramento , Calif. Cesar Chavez plaza during a recent protest , when people who had begun to march out of the plaza \u2014 came running right back . They were fleeing from tear gas that had been fired at them by the Sacramento police . Boykin , who has been a social justice advocate longer than she has worked in the emergency department at Sacramento \u2019 s UC Davis Medical Center , soon found herself overcome by tear gas , as well .\n\u201c I think hyper awareness that our lives are literally on the line definitely drew people into the streets , \u201d Boykin said of protesters standing up for an end to police violence \u2014 only to be subjected to police violence themselves . As a protest medic , Boykin said she has seen everything from a protester \u2019 s skull fractured by a police projectile , to abrasions on protesters who have fallen down , while running to avoid being shot or gassed .\nNational Nurses United ( NNU ) is the largest union of registered nurses in the country , representing Boykin and 150,000 other nurses , and these protesters are our patients . It \u2019 s our duty to advocate for their health safety , and that means standing up for racial justice and saying , \u201c Enough ! \u201d to the weapons of war used on people protesting the police violence that has killed George Floyd , Breonna Taylor , and countless others .\nTake tear gas , for example . This chemical weapon has proven fatal in documented cases and is banned in actual warfare , yet it is used liberally by police departments across the country on protesters . It can cause symptoms including vomiting , blurred vision , shortness of breath , tearing , difficulty swallowing , temporary blindness , pain \u2014 and coughing and sneezing . I \u2019 ll say that again for those in the back : It can cause coughing and sneezing during a pandemic when it \u2019 s critical not to spread the virus causing COVID-19 .\nIn addition , to tear gas , militarized police across the country have shown up to recent protests for racial justice and an end to police violence with flashbangs ( also known as stun grenades ) . These weapons have heat exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a blast of 175 decibels and can cause burns , hearing loss , temporary blindness , injuries from shrapnel , and death . Police have also fired rubber bullets , which often have a metal core , and are responsible for deaths , often from the head , neck , and torso trauma \u2014 and internal bleeding , organ damage , and bruising .\nThis is all not to mention other forms of police violence , including kicking , pushing , beating , and kettling protesters , leaving them with no way to escape police violence .\nNurses have seen these violent police tactics before , including during deployments of NNU \u2019 s Registered Nurse Response Network ( RNRN ) to Occupy Wall Street , to Standing Rock , and to the U.S.-Mexico border . At Standing Rock in 2016 , nurses met water protector Vanessa Dundon , whose eye was shot out by a tear gas canister fired by police \u2014 just as Brandon Saenz \u2019 s eye was recently shot out with \u201c less lethal ammunition \u201d at a May 30 Dallas protest , and freelance photographer Linda Tirado \u2019 s eye was shot out by a foam bullet at a May 29 Minneapolis protest .\nAs we connect the lines , nurses can see that police violence against protesters spans calendar years , locations , and protest issues ; it is ubiquitous .

        "content_original": "Registered nurse Asantewaa Boykin was volunteering as a medic in Sacramento, Calif. Cesar Chavez plaza during a recent protest, when people who had begun to march out of the plaza \u2014 came running right back. They were fleeing from tear gas that had been fired at them by the Sacramento police. Boykin, who has been a social justice advocate longer than she has worked in the emergency department at Sacramento\u2019s UC Davis Medical Center, soon found herself overcome by tear gas, as well.\n\n\u201cI think hyper awareness that our lives are literally on the line definitely drew people into the streets,\u201d Boykin said of protesters standing up for an end to police violence \u2014 only to be subjected to police violence themselves. As a protest medic, Boykin said she has seen everything from a protester\u2019s skull fractured by a police projectile, to abrasions on protesters who have fallen down, while running to avoid being shot or gassed.\n\nNational Nurses United (NNU) is the largest union of registered nurses in the country, representing Boykin and 150,000 other nurses, and these protesters are our patients. It\u2019s our duty to advocate for their health safety, and that means standing up for racial justice and saying, \u201cEnough!\u201d to the weapons of war used on people protesting the police violence that has killed George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTake tear gas, for example. This chemical weapon has proven fatal in documented cases and is banned in actual warfare, yet it is used liberally by police departments across the country on protesters. It can cause symptoms including vomiting, blurred vision, shortness of breath, tearing, difficulty swallowing, temporary blindness, pain \u2014 and coughing and sneezing. I\u2019ll say that again for those in the back: It can cause coughing and sneezing during a pandemic when it\u2019s critical not to spread the virus causing COVID-19.\n\nIn addition, to tear gas, militarized police across the country have shown up to recent protests for racial justice and an end to police violence with flashbangs (also known as stun grenades). These weapons have heat exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a blast of 175 decibels and can cause burns, hearing loss, temporary blindness, injuries from shrapnel, and death. Police have also fired rubber bullets, which often have a metal core, and are responsible for deaths, often from the head, neck, and torso trauma \u2014 and internal bleeding, organ damage, and bruising.\n\nThis is all not to mention other forms of police violence, including kicking, pushing, beating, and kettling protesters, leaving them with no way to escape police violence.\n\nNurses have seen these violent police tactics before, including during deployments of NNU\u2019s Registered Nurse Response Network (RNRN) to Occupy Wall Street, to Standing Rock, and to the U.S.-Mexico border. At Standing Rock in 2016, nurses met water protector Vanessa Dundon, whose eye was shot out by a tear gas canister fired by police \u2014 just as Brandon Saenz\u2019s eye was recently shot out with \u201cless lethal ammunition\u201d at a May 30 Dallas protest, and freelance photographer Linda Tirado\u2019s eye was shot out by a foam bullet at a May 29 Minneapolis protest.\n\nAs we connect the lines, nurses can see that police violence against protesters spans calendar years, locations, and protest issues; it is ubiquitous. As advocates for public health and safety, we call for an end to this violence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhat the police are doing is perpetuating a cycle of trauma and abuse that not only costs lives, but it can also \u2026 further perpetuate inequalities and injustices,\u201d said NNU member Heather Honstein, RN, pointing out that chronic stress alone can cause vast negative health impacts for individuals and communities brutalized by the police.\n\nA cardiovascular surgical ICU nurse at Washington D.C.\u2019s MedStar Washington Hospital, Honstein was among protesters gathered peacefully in Lafayette square near the White House on June 1. She left around 6 p.m., 30 minutes before federal police violently dispersed peaceful crowds, using gas canisters, grenades, and significant force.\n\nTrapped in her house a few miles away, with low-flying helicopters constantly humming overhead as a \u201cfear tactic,\u201d Honstein wished she could go back out and help more seriously in her capacity as a registered nurse. The next day, she sought out the official medics, already working in an organized way to provide medical help for protesters, and she joined them as a volunteer medic.\n\nAs nurses, we could never have predicted that we would simultaneously be on the front lines of a pandemic at work, and the front lines of a local battlefield in our free time. But it\u2019s 2020, and here we are.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The only people who come to protests dressed for war are police officers, and their use of force against protesters exercising their constitutional right to assembly is a threat to democracy. It\u2019s also a colossal waste of public resources that would be far better spent on public health and other social programs that are especially essential in the midst of a pandemic and economic crisis.

His actions amount to some of the most aggressive responses in the country . The new limit applies to all community , civic , public , leisure , faith-based events , as well as sporting events with spectators , concerts , and conventions . It covers fitness centers , private clubs and theaters .\nBaker announced Sunday that all bars and restaurants in Massachusetts would be shut down to on-premise consumption starting Tuesday through April 17 .\nGovernor Charlie Baker on Sunday night ordered all public and private schools across Massachusetts to close for three weeks , beginning Tuesday , and has limited all restaurants to only takeout and delivery as of Tuesday , in his most sweeping action yet to slow the increasing rate of the spread of the novel coronavirus .\n\u201c If we take decisive steps now and everyone plays their part by following the best medical guidance , we can slow down the spread , \u201d he said .\nThe governor stressed that grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open , pleaded with people not to hoard , and again noted that stores were getting regularly restocked .\nThe new restrictions on schools , restaurants and large gatherings will be lifted April 6 . At the same time , however , the US Centers for Disease Control recommended that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed over the next eight weeks .\nThe orders came against the backdrop of a spike of 26 new cases , bringing the total number of infected residents to 164 . As of 6 p.m. Sunday , state officials said 969 residents had been tested \u2014 more than double the number from the day before . State officials also said Sunday that there is now evidence of community spread in seven Massachusetts counties : Berkshire , Essex , Hampden , Norfolk , Middlesex , Suffolk , and Worcester .

It covers fitness centers, private clubs and theaters.\n\nBaker announced Sunday that all bars and restaurants in Massachusetts would be shut down to on-premise consumption starting Tuesday through April 17.\n\nGovernor Charlie Baker on Sunday night ordered all public and private schools across Massachusetts to close for three weeks, beginning Tuesday, and has limited all restaurants to only takeout and delivery as of Tuesday, in his most sweeping action yet to slow the increasing rate of the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI realize these measures are unprecedented,\" Baker said.\n\n\u201cIf we take decisive steps now and everyone plays their part by following the best medical guidance, we can slow down the spread,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor stressed that grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open, pleaded with people not to hoard, and again noted that stores were getting regularly restocked.\n\nThe new restrictions on schools, restaurants and large gatherings will be lifted April 6. At the same time, however, the US Centers for Disease Control recommended that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed over the next eight weeks.\n\nThe orders came against the backdrop of a spike of 26 new cases, bringing the total number of infected residents to 164. As of 6 p.m. Sunday, state officials said 969 residents had been tested \u2014 more than double the number from the day before. State officials also said Sunday that there is now evidence of community spread in seven Massachusetts counties: Berkshire, Essex, Hampden, Norfolk, Middlesex, Suffolk, and Worcester. That means residents are contracting the illness but the specific source of the infection is unknown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe facts on the ground have changed,\u201d Baker said. \u201cNow that we have evidence based on the testing results that we have community transmission in seven counties in Massachusetts, I think at this point in time it\u2019s particularly appropriate we not only move on the school closures, but also that we get a lot more aggressive around other places and spaces that people gather.\u201d\n\nThe goal of the governor\u2019s orders \u2014 and a variety of other new restrictions on public life across the state and the country \u2014 is to stem the wave of infections by keeping Americans apart from each other. That, experts hope, will help avoid overloading the health care system.\n\n\u201cThis is a time of shared sacrifice,\u201d Mayor Martin J. Walsh said Sunday. \u201cIt will save lives.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s orders came as governors in Illinois and Ohio also announced restrictions on bars and restaurants. New York City announced a shutdown of schools through at least April 20.\n\nThe new restrictions in Massachusetts came on yet another day of dizzying coronavirus news in the state. Earlier in the day Walsh declared a public health emergency in the city, imposing restrictions on restaurants, bars, and clubs.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has now infected a pair of health care providers at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, the Boston hospital said Sunday.\n\nAnd a worker at the Marriott Long Wharf hotel \u2014 the host of a February Biogen conference that was the source of many of the state\u2019s cases \u2014 also tested positive for the Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMassachusetts Bay Transportation Authority leaders said Sunday that they would run normal service Monday to service a dwindling ridership amid the outbreak. But the MBTA acknowledged that it could eventually follow other cities, including Washington, D.C., in cutting back the frequency of trains and buses. MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said the agency is working on \u201ccontingency plans\u201d that could lead to reductions.\n\nBaker on Sunday also ordered a broad array of additional responses to the pandemic, some of which will require approval by the Legislature this week. But even before outlining the new rules, he cautioned residents to ignore one widespread rumor.\n\n\u201cWe are not planning any shelter-in-place orders,\u201d Baker said. \u201cEveryone needs to get news from legitimate sources.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he would order commercial health insurers to allow patients to receive care via tele-health, letting them avoid in-person appointments. He directed hospitals to postpone elective surgeries, to make space for Covid-19 patients. And he prohibited visitors to assisted living residences; this is in addition to the federal ban issued Friday on visitors to nursing homes and rest homes.\n\nThe governor also authorized licensed pharmacies to create and sell hand sanitizer over the counter.\n\nBaker said he will extend some deadlines for motorists to renew documents at the Registry of Motor Vehicles, in an attempt to limit in-person transactions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe hopes to expand eligibility for collecting unemployment and wants to give municipalities the power to delay town meetings and the adoption of municipal budgets.\n\nThe governor ordered executive branch employees to stay home Monday and Tuesday and said his administration would work to expand alternative work arrangements for them going forward.\n\nAnd he recommended that all Massachusetts colleges and universities pursue strategies for distance education, keeping students from campus. Most major universities in the Boston area have already done so.\n\nBaker did not order the closure of child-care programs but strongly urged providers to strictly observe guidelines that call for temporary closures based on actual direct or indirect exposures to individuals with Covid-19.\n\nAt the Brigham, where the two health care workers were reported infected, hospital leaders said in a memo to staff that they are in close contact with state and city public health officials and are following their guidance about how to proceed.\n\n\u201cAs the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, it is inevitable that health care workers will be infected, as is now the case at the Brigham,\u201d wrote Dr. Charles Morris, associate chief medical officer and incident commander. ''We are in the process of contacting patients and staff who may have been exposed.''\n\n\"While this news is unsettling, please be assured that our Brigham community has been preparing for this eventuality, and we will continue to take every precaution to protect our patients, their loved ones and our staff throughout this unprecedented pandemic,'' wrote Morris. The memo was also signed by Julia Sinclair, senior vice president of clinical services and incident commander.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrigham spokesperson Erin McDonough said the providers did not work while symptomatic. She said the hospital can not identify or release details about the providers or their specific jobs because of privacy rules. Another person with knowledge of the situation said they are both doctors.\n\nMcDonough said in an e-mail that the hospital undertook an \u201cintensive tracing process\u201d that involved a detailed review of every patient and employee the providers interacted with during a particular time period.\n\nAmid all the precautions about the coronavirus spread, government leaders were aghast Sunday at reports of crowds spotted flocking to bars and restaurants in South Boston Saturday night.\n\nThe city\u2019s Licensing Board moved swiftly Sunday \u2014 even before Baker\u2019s broader restrictions were announced in the evening \u2014 announcing a voluntary agreement with more than a dozen bars and restaurants to shut down.\n\nThe mayor announced in the morning that he would restrict Boston restaurants, bars, and clubs to half their capacity and to close their doors each night by 11. But Walsh\u2019s order was ultimately overtaken by Baker\u2019s broader bans.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunday, Senator Edward J. Markey called for a wartime-like mobilization of private manufacturing to supply hospitals with the tests and protective equipment they need to handle the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn a Boston press conference, Markey urged the Trump administration to use the Defense Production Act, a law passed near the start of the Korean War in 1950, to mobilize private industry for defense production. Markey called for exponential increases in production of testing kits and protective gear such as respirator masks for health care workers.\n\nMarkey\u2019s comments were echoed by Dr. Peter Slavin, the president of Massachusetts General Hospital, who said he\u2019s worried about the shortage of personal protective equipment needed to keep doctors and nurses safe as they confront rising numbers of infected patients.\n\n\u201cWe need to think of this in almost a war-like stance,\u201d Slavin said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\u201cEven before the most significant battles [that] lie ahead, our supplies are low,\" he said of the protective gear. \"We wouldn\u2019t want to send soldiers into war without helmets and armor.

Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nIn this November \u2019 s election , China will be front and center for two reasons . Ad Policy\nFirst , in 2016 , Trump centered his promise to rebalance trade and rebuild American manufacturing\u2014a promise undelivered , with the tariffs mostly punishing American workers\u2014around China . Second , the national security challenges of China \u2019 s preeminence , far from being quarantined in Trump world , are now a concern for most of the world \u2019 s democracies .\nTrump campaigned against China last time , promising to \u201c decouple \u201d the US economy from the emerging superpower , but the coronavirus reveals just how little he has been able to deliver . Tariffs can be needed safeguards for worker adjustment in some industries , and in response to unfair trade policies of specific countries . But they can \u2019 t rebuild America \u2019 s industrial capacity . Because the problem is not just direct imports ; it is the entanglement of complex global supply chains with Chinese sources .\nChina is now the focus of the conversation in part because the coronavirus-induced global supply-chain crisis that is just beginning will make even more people think about our extreme dependence on Chinese manufacturing . It \u2019 s an issue Democrats haven \u2019 t owned , and in some cases have outright dismissed . Coronavirus Prayer Will Not Stop Coronavirus Rev . Dr. William J. Barber II and Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove The 2020 Election in the Time of Pandemic Tom Tomorrow Republican Xenophobia Is Going to Make the Pandemic Much Worse Jeet Heer More in this series\nIt \u2019 s time Democrats start paying attention to the gulf between Sanders and Biden ( and Trump ) on China . Sanders alone has always made building American manufacturing capacity central to his platform : a winning message , and one whose urgency is made all the more clear given the coronavirus .\nJoe Biden , on the other hand , is even worse than Trump on China . Biden \u2019 s policy is : Why bother to worry ? At a campaign rally , Biden dismissed Trump , saying , \u201c China is going to eat our lunch ? Come on , man\u2026they can \u2019 t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east , I mean in the west\u2026 . I mean , you know , they \u2019 re not bad folks , folks . But guess what , they \u2019 re not , they \u2019 re not competition for us . \u201d\nAs a political matter , this shows a remarkable lack of awareness of how workers across the country feel about China . As a factual matter , this is incorrect . In terms of policy , Biden represents the Clinton approach towards trade\u2014an approach that lost America jobs , lost us leverage over the climate crisis , and lost the Democratic Party huge swaths of rank-and-file labor support . Current Issue View our current issue\nSanders \u2019 s approach towards China , on the other hand , fits in with the general approach toward labor and trade that he has championed his entire life . He has been unusually strong in his opposition to the way that trade deals have favored the interests of Wall Street and Big Pharma over workers and Main Street . He saw right from the start the risks of opening up imports from China on World Trade Organization terms and voted against changes in US tariffs that would allow that .\nWhat Sanders alone has been able to articulate is something that most American workers understand , and climate activists get right away : China \u2019 s \u201c competitiveness \u201d is driven by burning coal to the point that its emissions cancel out everyone else \u2019 s efforts to tackle climate change . The current status quo is not fair ; it destroys American productive capacity ; and it is definitely not green . Who benefits ? Offshoring American companies\u2014often through global corporate structures that avoid paying taxes\u2014have benefited from the opening to China ; and so has Wall Street . Deals , deals , deals . They have profited on the backs of American workers , as Sanders has never ceased to point out .\nThis should not be confused with fortress nationalism . Intoxicated by China \u2019 s apparent successes , we have allowed its leaders to define the debate about globalism and nationalism . In fact , regaining innovation-driven manufacturing in America will entail a new globalism , cooperating with partners whether in Europe , or Bangalore , or Guangzho\u2014but driven by a common purpose in greening the economy , not the tax-avoiding exploitative capitalism of offshoring and financialization . This isn \u2019 t just about us ; it \u2019 s about workers and citizens everywhere . If China itself can not shift to a different model of growth and development , China \u2019 s workers along with ours will succumb to the catastrophe of unstoppable climate change\nThe importance of this approach is becoming even more obvious this week , as we see how the trade policy of the past 30 years has radically weakened our ability to respond to a crisis like coronavirus . When American manufacturing capacity is at an all-time low and there are thousands of essential goods that aren \u2019 t manufactured here at all , it makes us vulnerable to huge supply-chain shocks . While Sanders has consistently attacked trade deals that sell workers out and benefit big corporate interests , he , unlike Trump , also sees that protectionism\u2014indiscriminate hikes in tariff barriers\u2014is not the solution . Activist domestic industrial , social , and economic policies are the route to rebuilding America \u2019 s resilience as a great manufacturing country , powered by a proud , productive , and decently rewarded , working class\u2014and key to a robust China policy .\nWhen key imports are all sourced internationally , it increases the risk of supply-chain disruptions . If a large percentage of any product , or any ingredient in a product\u2014be that a ball bearing or a chemical or a charger\u2014comes from a region in China that is quarantined , all the products that depend on that ingredient get stuck without replacement . On the other hand , if manufacturing were dispersed throughout both the United States and other countries , we would be ready for crises because we could quickly ramp up production in the American facilities , with governmental support .\nTrump \u2019 s failures prove the fragility of the current system can \u2019 t be fixed by punishing imports at the border . Global supply-chain networks are notoriously complicated ; many distributors have no idea about the status of their upstream suppliers\u2014where they are located , how many alternative sources exist , how much product is stockpiled . Only in an emergency is the fragility of the chain revealed .\nFor instance , when a major earthquake hit Japan in 2011 , it took a while before auto factories\u2014who bought their paints from suppliers\u2014realized that the only factory in the world that made a paint pigment required for black paint had been hit by the earthquake .

Did you know you can support The Nation by drinking wine?\n\nIn this November\u2019s election, China will be front and center for two reasons. Ad Policy\n\nFirst, in 2016, Trump centered his promise to rebalance trade and rebuild American manufacturing\u2014a promise undelivered, with the tariffs mostly punishing American workers\u2014around China. Second, the national security challenges of China\u2019s preeminence, far from being quarantined in Trump world, are now a concern for most of the world\u2019s democracies.\n\nTrump campaigned against China last time, promising to \u201cdecouple\u201d the US economy from the emerging superpower, but the coronavirus reveals just how little he has been able to deliver. Tariffs can be needed safeguards for worker adjustment in some industries, and in response to unfair trade policies of specific countries. But they can\u2019t rebuild America\u2019s industrial capacity. Because the problem is not just direct imports; it is the entanglement of complex global supply chains with Chinese sources.\n\nChina is now the focus of the conversation in part because the coronavirus-induced global supply-chain crisis that is just beginning will make even more people think about our extreme dependence on Chinese manufacturing. It\u2019s an issue Democrats haven\u2019t owned, and in some cases have outright dismissed. Coronavirus Prayer Will Not Stop Coronavirus Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II and Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove The 2020 Election in the Time of Pandemic Tom Tomorrow Republican Xenophobia Is Going to Make the Pandemic Much Worse Jeet Heer More in this series\n\nIt\u2019s time Democrats start paying attention to the gulf between Sanders and Biden (and Trump) on China. Sanders alone has always made building American manufacturing capacity central to his platform: a winning message, and one whose urgency is made all the more clear given the coronavirus.\n\nJoe Biden, on the other hand, is even worse than Trump on China. Biden\u2019s policy is: Why bother to worry? At a campaign rally, Biden dismissed Trump, saying, \u201cChina is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man\u2026they can\u2019t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east, I mean in the west\u2026. I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nAs a political matter, this shows a remarkable lack of awareness of how workers across the country feel about China. As a factual matter, this is incorrect. In terms of policy, Biden represents the Clinton approach towards trade\u2014an approach that lost America jobs, lost us leverage over the climate crisis, and lost the Democratic Party huge swaths of rank-and-file labor support. Current Issue View our current issue\n\nSanders\u2019s approach towards China, on the other hand, fits in with the general approach toward labor and trade that he has championed his entire life. He has been unusually strong in his opposition to the way that trade deals have favored the interests of Wall Street and Big Pharma over workers and Main Street. He saw right from the start the risks of opening up imports from China on World Trade Organization terms and voted against changes in US tariffs that would allow that.\n\nWhat Sanders alone has been able to articulate is something that most American workers understand, and climate activists get right away: China\u2019s \u201ccompetitiveness\u201d is driven by burning coal to the point that its emissions cancel out everyone else\u2019s efforts to tackle climate change. The current status quo is not fair; it destroys American productive capacity; and it is definitely not green. Who benefits? Offshoring American companies\u2014often through global corporate structures that avoid paying taxes\u2014have benefited from the opening to China; and so has Wall Street. Deals, deals, deals. They have profited on the backs of American workers, as Sanders has never ceased to point out.\n\nThis should not be confused with fortress nationalism. Intoxicated by China\u2019s apparent successes, we have allowed its leaders to define the debate about globalism and nationalism. In fact, regaining innovation-driven manufacturing in America will entail a new globalism, cooperating with partners whether in Europe, or Bangalore, or Guangzho\u2014but driven by a common purpose in greening the economy, not the tax-avoiding exploitative capitalism of offshoring and financialization. This isn\u2019t just about us; it\u2019s about workers and citizens everywhere. If China itself cannot shift to a different model of growth and development, China\u2019s workers along with ours will succumb to the catastrophe of unstoppable climate change\n\nThe importance of this approach is becoming even more obvious this week, as we see how the trade policy of the past 30 years has radically weakened our ability to respond to a crisis like coronavirus.

Activist domestic industrial, social, and economic policies are the route to rebuilding America\u2019s resilience as a great manufacturing country, powered by a proud, productive, and decently rewarded, working class\u2014and key to a robust China policy.\n\nWhen key imports are all sourced internationally, it increases the risk of supply-chain disruptions. If a large percentage of any product, or any ingredient in a product\u2014be that a ball bearing or a chemical or a charger\u2014comes from a region in China that is quarantined, all the products that depend on that ingredient get stuck without replacement. On the other hand, if manufacturing were dispersed throughout both the United States and other countries, we would be ready for crises because we could quickly ramp up production in the American facilities, with governmental support.\n\nTrump\u2019s failures prove the fragility of the current system can\u2019t be fixed by punishing imports at the border.

The coronavirus is not a drill: We need this kind of investment right now. But you can\u2019t get it just by propping up Wall Street.\n\nHow would a Sanders presidency address this?

Only 13 percent of Republicans said Trump should encourage the protesters.\n\n\"In fact, only a quarter of people who support the protesters think the president should encourage the protests,\" CBS writes.\n\nTRUMP AND THE PROTESTERS: Very few Americans \u2013 only 7% - feel President Trump should encourage these protests.

This is consistent with other recent polls, and on Wednesday, an Associated Press poll found that 61 percent say current social distancing measures are about right, with another 26 percent saying they don't go far enough.\n\nThe CBS poll was conducted by speaking to a sample of 2,112 U.S. residents from April 20-22. The margin of error is 2.5 percentage points. Read more at CBS. Brendan Morrow",
