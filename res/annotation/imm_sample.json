Whether the House can actually produce such a bill, and then square it with the Senate's, remains to be seen.\n\nHere are three big reasons why immigration will be heavy lift in the House:\n\n1. Uncertainty from Leadership\n\nEarlier this year, both Boehner and Cantor sounded optimistic tones on immigration reform. The duo had remained coy about how they will handle the issue, but their tone gave supporters hope that longstanding Republican opposition to a comprehensive bill had disappeared.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nThe reality is that Republican leadership is facing dueling tensions within their party. On one hand, party elites and political strategists see the writing on the wall: Republicans need to act on immigration reform in order to tap into the Hispanic and Asian-American electorate (and actually have a shot at winning national elections).\n\nBut on the other hand, there's a large group of conservative GOP lawmakers who aren't so fond of immigration reform, to put it mildly.

A Wild Card Conference\n\nFor every Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Ra\u00fal Labrador who want to compromise on immigration, there's a Steve King, Louie Gohmert and Steve Stockman who will fight tooth and nail against it.\n\nThe latter trio is leading the opposition to immigration reform in the House. All three are known for making outlandish, and sometimes offensive, statements about immigration reform or immigrants.\n\nIn the 21st century, that would seem to marginalize a politician. But if King & Co. are able to foment conservative outrage against the bill, we could see a repeat of 2007. Then, a similar bill was sunk by a revolt from talk-radio hosts, grassroots groups, and right-wing lawmakers.\n\nKing and other Republicans are already trying to compare immigration to President Obama's healthcare law. And we all remember how conservatives reacted to that.\n\n3. A Fractured Gang\n\nThe House has its own bipartisan Gang of Eight, which has been meeting on and off for nearly four years to craft a comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n\nThe group of four Democrats and four Republicans announced they had reached a deal in principle last week. But that pronouncement now appears to have been made prematurely.\n\nPolitico reports that lawmakers agreed on a compromise over whether immigrants applying for citizenship should receive government-subsidized healthcare. But other significant issues remain unresolved, like provisions around border-security.\n\nIf the group is unable to agree on a comprehensive proposal, that could lead to a flood of bills that deal with immigration issues on a piecemeal basis.

It would represent the most significant changes to U.S. immigration policy in nearly three decades , though it would fall far short of the comprehensive legislation supporters have been trying to pass since the George W. Bush administration .\nGOP reaction was swift and sharply negative , with Republicans saying the president is overstepping his authority , refusing to work with Congress and ignoring the will of voters , who this month delivered the GOP control of both houses of Congress . The White House cast the issue as an urgent policy priority .\n\u201c Everybody agrees that our immigration system is broken . Unfortunately , Washington has allowed the problem to fester for too long , \u201d Mr. Obama said in a video released on the White House \u2019 s Facebook page Wednesday afternoon . He said he would use his authority to \u201c make the system work better . \u201d\nThe moves , and the GOP response , will likely extinguish an already dim chance of legislative action on immigration . Republican leaders , buoyed by their Senate win and stronger hold on the House after the midterms , warned that cooperation on other matters would be more difficult , as well .\n\u201c Sticking your finger in the eye of a recently elected Republican Congress is about as bad a way as I can think of to start off the last two years of what could be a productive term , \u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R. , Tenn. ) .\nAs an executive action , Mr. Obama \u2019 s policy could be overturned by a future president , though it could prove politically complicated to strip people of protected status once they have it .\nPresident Obama is also expected to make a speech at Del Sol High School in Las Vegas on Friday . European Pressphoto Agency\nRepublicans were debating among themselves how to counter the president \u2019 s move . Some GOP lawmakers were pushing leaders to write limits on Mr. Obama into legislation that must pass by Dec. 11 to keep the government funded\u2014a course sure to draw a presidential veto threat and raise the prospect of a partial government shutdown . Others in the GOP counseled a less confrontational path .\nOptions being discussed include passing GOP-stamped immigration bills , passing stand-alone legislation next year to block Mr. Obama \u2019 s action and filing suit against the president , hoping a judge would intervene .\nMr. Obama is scheduled to lay out his policy in a speech to the nation Thursday at 8 p.m. EST , and then on Friday at a Las Vegas high school . It is the same school where the president , in a speech in early 2013 , laid out principles for immigration legislation that later passed the Democrat-led Senate but died in the GOP-controlled House .\nMr. Obama got immediate backup from his party . \u201c We have waited long enough for House Republicans . Since they won \u2019 t act , the president should , and he will , \u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) said on the Senate floor Wednesday .\nUnder the new policy , undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents who have been in the U.S. for at least five years would win a temporary stay of deportation and be eligible for work permits , according to several people briefed , including several Democratic lawmakers briefed by Mr. Obama over dinner Wednesday at the White House .\nRep. Joe Crowley ( D. , N.Y. ) , one of those briefed , said that the new policy is expected to benefit between 4 million and 5 million undocumented residents . Another congressman at the dinner said the figure would approach 5 million . Another person familiar with the plan said about 4 million would be eligible because of their family ties and longevity , and up to a million more through other provisions .\nRep. Ben Ray Lujan ( D. , N.M. ) said that to be eligible , people will have to undergo a background check , pay any back taxes and go through an application process . He added that the plan will also include stepped up border security .\nThe president is also expected to expand eligibility for a 2012 program that gives safe harbor from deportation to young people brought into the U.S. illegally as children , for instance by increasing the age limit for participation , people briefed on the plan said . This group , sometimes called Dreamers , has pressed Mr. Obama to use executive authority to protect illegal immigrants . But Mr. Obama wasn \u2019 t expected to extend protections to their parents , their top policy goal .\nAsked about the exclusion of Dreamer parents , Rep. Lujan said , \u201c The president is taking the action he is able to . This is a first step . \u201d\nMr. Obama told lawmakers that he didn \u2019 t want to halt his plans because some Republicans have raised the possibility of another government shutdown .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not running away from this because of the artificial deadlines that have been set up , \u201d Mr. Crowley said , explaining the president \u2019 s position .\nThe plan is also set to reorder immigration-enforcement priorities and revamp or replace the Secure Communities program , which uses local law enforcement to identify undocumented immigrants , one person briefed said . The person said it would also include a provision sought by businesses that would make it easier for students awaiting work visas to stay in the U.S .\nThe United Farm Workers estimated that at least 250,000 farm workers would be protected from deportation under criteria laid out for the union president , Arturo Rodriguez , in a meeting with Mr. Obama on Wednesday . The union estimates that there are about a million undocumented farm workers in the U.S. , though others put it lower .\nOne provision sought by businesses , particularly high-tech companies , isn \u2019 t in Mr. Obama \u2019 s package , several people said . It would have made available employment visas that were unused in previous years .\nA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll , released Wednesday , found the president facing headwinds in laying out his policy , though public support for legalization of undocumented immigrants remains high .\nThe survey found 48 % of Americans disapprove of Mr. Obama \u2019 s acting without Congress on immigration , while 38 % approve . Even among Latinos , who overwhelmingly favor legalization for undocumented immigrants , 43 % say they approved of Mr. Obama acting alone , while 37 % didn \u2019 t .\nSupport for a pathway to citizenship for those in the U.S. illegally remained robust , with 57 % of respondents favoring such a plan and 40 % opposing . Support grew to 74 % when people were given likely details of such a plan , including requirements illegal immigrants pay a fine and back taxes , and pass a security background check before qualifying for legal status .\n\u201c The public wants this policy , \u201d said Fred Yang , a Democratic pollster who co-directs the survey . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t mean they \u2019 ll be happy with how it might get done . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s course presents risks to both parties . For Mr. Obama , areas of agreement with Republicans in the remainder of his term\u2014such as trade promotion and an overhaul of the corporate tax code\u2014are sure to be more difficult , given the acrimony . Some Senate Republicans said they would be less inclined to approve his nominees .\nRep. Paul Ryan ( R. , Wis. ) warned in an interview that Mr. Obama \u2019 s action would make agreement on a tax overhaul less likely . It \u201c would definitely hurt , that \u2019 s for sure , \u201d he said .\nOther Republicans worried an overheated response could backfire on the GOP . They said the party must show it can effectively govern\u2014a challenge , given that some in the party are urging a budget showdown to protest Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan . Others said the debate threatened efforts to improve the party \u2019 s shaky standing with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to have to control our response , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) . He said it was important that his party keep its criticism focused on perceived executive overreach and that Republicans not allow themselves to be cast as opposing immigration or immigrants .\n\u201c I \u2019 m very concerned that there will be loud voices in our party who have been complete demagogues on immigration , who have no solution , and people in my party will cater to them , \u201d Mr. Graham said .\nAnd Sen.

Lawmakers in both chambers have been working on omnibus legislation tying together 12 tailored spending bills that would fund the government through September 2015 , the end of the fiscal year . But GOP anger over the immigration action makes it harder to pass ambitious spending policy and more likely that Congress will simply extend the government \u2019 s current funding levels into early 2015 , said lawmakers and aides .\nOne route Republicans may pursue is to fund almost all of the government through September 2015 , but extend funding just until early next year for the agencies or programs that Mr. Obama would need to implement the executive action .

Yet even if the bill clears the Senate , the GOP-controlled House isn \u2019 t likely to take it up in its current form .\nThe vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments .

Yet even if the bill clears the Senate, the GOP-controlled House isn\u2019t likely to take it up in its current form.\n\n( PHOTOS: At a glance: The Senate immigration deal)\n\nThe vote came after the committee deliberated for five days and considered more than 200 amendments.

        "content": "The tragic killing of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts \u2013 allegedly by an illegal immigrant from Mexico \u2013 appears to be yet another example of America \u2019 s dangerous and failed immigration policy .\nAuthorities in Iowa charged a man identified as Cristhian Rivera with first-degree murder Tuesday in Tibbetts \u2019 death . He is being held in jail on a $ 5 million cash-only bond .\nAccording to authorities , Rivera \u2013 if that is really his name \u2013 is a 24-year old illegal immigrant from Mexico , whose movements driving a black SUV in the area of Tibbetts \u2019 disappearance were caught on security cameras . Tibbets disappeared July 18 while she was running in the rural central Iowa town of Brooklyn .\nHow many more needless deaths will it take for our immigration policies to change ?\nApologists for illegal immigration are already trying to deflect public attention from this horrific case .\nWhen asked about Tibbetts \u2019 killing on CNN , Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass . \u2013 beloved by far-left Democrats and a possible presidential contender in 2020 \u2013 said that she knows this is hard for the Tibbetts family . However , she said that our focus should be \u201c on where the real problems are , \u201d which she said is the separation of \u201c mamas and babies \u201d who entered the U.S. illegally at the border .\nFordham University Professor Christina Greer lamented on MSNBC that \u201c \u2588\u2588\u2588 is talking about a girl in Iowa \u201d instead of devoting more air time to court proceedings Tuesday resulting in felony convictions for former Trump presidential campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a guilty plea to other crimes by President Trump \u2019 s former attorney , Michael Cohen . Greer later backtracked for what she called her \u201c flippant \u201d remark about Tibbetts .\nAmericans should not be distracted by the chirping of these and other advocates of open borders , including the Cato Institute , which claims misleadingly that illegal immigrants commit fewer crimes than Americans . Even if that statement was factual ( it isn \u2019 t ) , it is completely irrelevant to this case , and no comfort to the victims .\nThe reality is that while most illegal immigrants are not violent , many do commit crimes , sometimes horrific ones , just like Americans do .\nThe nonpartisan Government Accountability Office estimates in a new report that since 1974 there have been more than 32,000 immigrants incarcerated for homicide in federal and state prisons . Other government reports show that most of these criminal immigrants are in the country illegally . They are not usually legal immigrants , who are vetted for criminal records .\nIt sounds obvious , but nowadays it is necessary to remind lawmakers that these homicides and many other crimes could have been prevented with better border security to block illegal entry into the U.S .\nThe fact that illegal immigration exacerbates crime is not lost on America \u2019 s local law enforcement agencies . Sheriffs and police leaders have become more and more outspoken in recent years urging the federal government \u2013 and especially Congress \u2013 to shore up our immigration enforcement .\nHundreds of sheriffs signed a letter to Congress in the spring , asking for the passage of a House bill to improve enforcement . The letter states : \u201c Year after year , we have been warning the Federal government about detrimental increases in transnational drug trafficking , gang violence , sex trafficking , murder , and other escalating incidents of crime by illegal aliens entering our country . \u201d\nNot only are criminal immigrants a threat to the community , they are a strain on taxpayers . The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $ 2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 \u2013 not including the additional cost of arrest , prosecution , deportation , and of course , the cost to the victims . Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers .\nThe killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country .\nRivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm , where he apparently worked for four years . It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver \u2019 s license .\nAuthorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name . That \u2019 s a common practice for unlicensed drivers , and another in the list of crimes of \u201c otherwise law-abiding \u201d illegal immigrants .\nAn estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents . Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect , but incidents of total identity theft \u2013 in which the illegal immigrant uses the name , date of birth , and Social Security number of a real person \u2013 have become more common .\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on this practice . Last month , Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Boston to announce the results of Operation Double Trouble . Under the enforcement operation , dozens of illegal immigrants were charged with identity theft-related crimes , including fraudulently obtaining Medicaid and other welfare benefits , and registering to vote .\nSome of those charged are heroin traffickers , who have obtained U.S. passports to facilitate their deadly illicit commerce .\nThe Social Security Administration , the Internal Revenue Service , and immigration agencies must be empowered to work together to act on instances of the multiple use of Social Security numbers that are easily detectable within government tax and crime databases .\nCitizens should be notified when their Social Security numbers have been compromised . Employers should have to terminate illegal workers when detected . Agencies should use facial recognition technology more frequently to detect imposters .\nAs long as prospective illegal immigrants believe that after making it past border and visa controls they will be able to get a job , a driver \u2019 s license , and live as if they were in the U.S. legally , they will continue to come .\nLike the smuggling rings , the identity document industry is part of the infrastructure of illegal immigration . And like the smugglers , the document vendors do not care whether their clients are harmless workers , drug traffickers , terrorists or criminals .\nWhen authorities allow such illicit enterprises to flourish , they are inviting more illegal immigration , and setting the stage for more atrocities committed by people who should not have found it so easy to get here and stay here illegally .",

The letter states: \u201cYear after year, we have been warning the Federal government about detrimental increases in transnational drug trafficking, gang violence, sex trafficking, murder, and other escalating incidents of crime by illegal aliens entering our country.\u201d\n\nNot only are criminal immigrants a threat to the community, they are a strain on taxpayers. The same GAO report found that federal and state governments spent about $2.5 billion on incarcerating foreign criminals in 2015 \u2013 not including the additional cost of arrest, prosecution, deportation, and of course, the cost to the victims. Now we see how high the cost can be to Iowans for some of the low-wage workers demanded by local farmers.\n\nThe killing of Mollie Tibbetts also highlights the role of identity fraud in facilitating the illegal employment that draws most illegal immigrants to this country.\n\nRivera reportedly used a false identity to secure an Iowa photo ID card and may have used these documents to secure employment at a farm, where he apparently worked for four years. It has not been revealed if he used these same documents to get a driver\u2019s license.\n\nAuthorities said the Chevy Malibu that Rivera used to stalk Tibbetts and then transport her body to the corn field where she was later found was not registered in his name. That\u2019s a common practice for unlicensed drivers, and another in the list of crimes of \u201cotherwise law-abiding\u201d illegal immigrants.\n\nAn estimated 75 percent of illegal immigrants obtain false documents. Counterfeit green cards are not difficult to detect, but incidents of total identity theft \u2013 in which the illegal immigrant uses the name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a real person \u2013 have become more common.\n\nThe Trump administration is cracking down on this practice. Last month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions traveled to Boston to announce the results of Operation Double Trouble. Under the enforcement operation, dozens of illegal immigrants were charged with identity theft-related crimes, including fraudulently obtaining Medicaid and other welfare benefits, and registering to vote.\n\nSome of those charged are heroin traffickers, who have obtained U.S. passports to facilitate their deadly illicit commerce.\n\nMore can be done, even without passing new laws.\n\nThe Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and immigration agencies must be empowered to work together to act on instances of the multiple use of Social Security numbers that are easily detectable within government tax and crime databases.\n\nCitizens should be notified when their Social Security numbers have been compromised. Employers should have to terminate illegal workers when detected. Agencies should use facial recognition technology more frequently to detect imposters.\n\nAs long as prospective illegal immigrants believe that after making it past border and visa controls they will be able to get a job, a driver\u2019s license, and live as if they were in the U.S. legally, they will continue to come.\n\nLike the smuggling rings, the identity document industry is part of the infrastructure of illegal immigration. And like the smugglers, the document vendors do not care whether their clients are harmless workers, drug traffickers, terrorists or criminals.\n\nWhen authorities allow such illicit enterprises to flourish, they are inviting more illegal immigration, and setting the stage for more atrocities committed by people who should not have found it so easy to get here and stay here illegally.",
