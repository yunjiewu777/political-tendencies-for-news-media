        "content": "WASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The U.S. Congress on Monday inched toward a $ 450 billion deal to help small businesses and hospitals hurt by the coronavirus pandemic , with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying negotiators had come to terms on the \u2018 principles \u2019 of the package as the Senate set a Tuesday session for a potential vote .\nRepublicans and Democrats have been battling for more than a week over what to include in the fourth round of financial stimulus intended to ease the heavy economic toll of a pandemic that has killed more than 42,000 Americans .\nIn an interview with CNN , Pelosi said Republican and Democratic negotiators were still in talks , adding : \u201c I feel very optimistic and hopeful that we \u2019 ll come to a conclusion tonight . \u201d\n\u201c We have I believe come to terms on the principles of the legislation , which is a good thing ... now we \u2019 re down to the fine print , \u201d Pelosi said .\nThe two sides had sought to finish the package earlier on Monday , but failed amid continued disagreements over , among other things , a coronavirus testing strategy .\n\u201c However , since this is so urgent , I \u2019 ve asked that the Senate meet again ... and the Democratic leader has agreed to my request , \u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor .\nThe 78-year-old Republican then left the chamber , putting on a mask to speak briefly with reporters in the hallway .\nPelosi had told fellow congressional Democrats on a conference call she believed an agreement could be reached on Monday night , and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said a vote was possible on the House of Representatives floor on Wednesday , according to a Democratic aide familiar with the call .\nPresident Donald Trump told a White House news briefing he hoped congressional negotiators would reach a deal soon .\n\u201c A lot of progress has been made on that , \u201d he said .\nA deal would end a stalemate over Trump \u2019 s request to add to a small-business loan program . Congress set up the program last month as part of a $ 2.3 trillion coronavirus economic relief plan , but it has already run out of money .\nMcConnell complained that an agreement had not been reached because \u201c our Democratic colleagues are still prolonging their discussions with the ( Trump ) administration . \u201d\nPelosi told CNN there would be about $ 120 billion in the small-business aid package geared to underbanked , minority-owned businesses . She said Democrats also were seeking $ 75 billion for hospitals and $ 25 billion for testing .\n\u201c Testing is one of the places where we want the language to be as good as we can agree to ; that we need a national strategy for testing , \u201d Pelosi said .\nWidespread testing is crucial before U.S. governors can lift extensive stay-at-home orders and advisories intended to slow the spread of the respiratory disease . Trump has talked about testing as largely a state responsibility .\nRepresentative Lee Zeldin , a Republican , said on Fox News that a bipartisan deal that would include $ 310 billion for small-business aid was progressing .\nZeldin said at least $ 50 billion more would be available for a separate small-business loan program under the deal , a provision still under negotiation . A Democratic source familiar with the talks has said that figure was more likely to be $ 60 billion .\nBut Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said aid for states and municipalities sought by Democrats would be excluded in the current plan . Trump said on Sunday he favored more aid for state and local governments but that it could be provided later .\nThat apparent omission was one reason a leading progressive Democrat , Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , denounced the outlines of the bill , calling it \u201c insulting . \u201d\nIf the Republican-majority Senate passes the bill on Tuesday , it could move to the Democratic-majority House as soon as Wednesday . Leaders there have told members they may try using a remote proxy voting system that a leading Democrat has proposed , said Representative Mark Pocan .\nThe proxy system would mean not all of the House \u2019 s 429 current members would have to be present for the vote , reducing the threat of spreading the coronavirus .",

        "date": "2020-07-21",
        "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump 's sudden rediscovery of the pandemic , his endorsement of masks and the return of his notorious briefings suggest a belated realization that public scorn over his denial-plagued leadership could end his presidency .\nTrump suggested Monday that `` many people say '' that wearing a mask to prevent the spread of the disease is patriotic , in a tweet using ambiguous language that hinted at his discomfort over the reversal . The grudging move followed weeks of the President politicizing and undermining government advice on face coverings . Once he shared a tweet mocking his Democratic rival Joe Biden for wearing one .\nTrump also promised he 'd return to front briefings on the government 's response to the crisis on television as early as Tuesday , after weeks of trying to distract from fast climbing infection rates and attacking the science-based advice of government officials . No members of the White House 's coronavirus task force -- including Drs . Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx -- are currently expected to join Trump 's Tuesday briefing , a person familiar with the plan told CNN , but cautioned that could change .\nFive months into the worst domestic crisis since World War II , and after his disastrous call to open up states that had not yet purged the disease sparked a surge of infections , the President may finally be understanding that his performance during the pandemic will be decisive in November 's election . But his recent comments and the actions of his government also indicate a mostly cosmetic public relations attempt to convince the public he 's in charge rather than a complete rethink of strategy as the virus rages out of control .\nBriefings will offer Trump a return to the television screens that he craves and likely not coincidentally will resume after he told supporters at the weekend that the worsening pandemic will keep him off the campaign trail for now .\nHis reversal on masks could be positive if it convinces conservatives who see covering up as an infringement of their freedoms to take a step that could slow the spread . But his delay in acting may have irrevocably damaged public trust in government health recommendations and contributed to the wildfire spread of the disease , especially in western and southern states .\nThe President is hardly leading here -- he 's following the example of many Republican governors wh o broke with him on masks as the virus pulverized their states . There 's also no guarantee that Trump 's higher profile on the disease will reverse his political slide since the last round of the Trump Covid show ended after his testy , meandering appearances degenerated into open musing of whethe r ingesting disinfectant could cure the virus \u2014 making him look absurdly ill-suited to handle the situation .\nSeveral sources told CNN on Monday that aides , after seeing Trump 's polling slide ahead of November 's election , have spent considerable energy trying to convince him he needs to show leadership on the accelerating pandemic and to get ahead of the story .\nTrump 's new briefings will be watched for signs that he is committed to leveling with the American people about the true nature of the challenge and that he 's learned from and acknowledged his mistakes and offers true leadership .\nBut he made clear Monday that his greatest concern was not rampant figures on new infections or a death toll of more than 140,000 Americans .\nWhen he unveiled the comeback of his briefings in the Oval Office alongside Republican congressional leaders , it was as though it was Sweeps week when TV networks preview new seasons of their top shows .\n`` We had very successful briefings . I was doing them , and we had a lot of people watching , record numbers watching . And in the history of cable television , television , there 's never been anything like it , '' Trump said .\nThe President implied that he would yet again paint a misleadingly positive vision of the pandemic , over-hyping good news on issues like treatments and vaccine developments rather than the discouraging reality of the situation . And as before , it seems likely that he will lay blame with others .\n`` I will be discussing , as I call it , the China virus , the China plague , '' Trump said Monday .\nThe President 's decision to again make himself the face of the pandemic appears to represent a characteristic gut call that no one can present his case better than he can .\nIf the President can limit skepticism about his handling of the virus in suburban areas that he is currently targeting with a searing law-and-order message , it 's possible he could begin to improve his political fortunes . His reversal on masks comes amid increasing signs of frustration among Washington Republicans as Election Day approaches .\nIt follows a torrent of polling suggesting that Trump is at risk of a thumping loss to former Vice President Joe Biden in November 's election and that the public is despairing of his management of the virus as it marches across states like Texas , Florida and Arizona . In a Washington Post/ABC News poll at the weekend , Trump trailed the Democrat presumptive nominee by 20 points when voters were asked who would better handle the pandemic .\n`` He just seems to have given up . He 's raised the white flag , '' Biden told a virtual fundraiser on Monday . `` Just ignoring the pandemic wo n't make it go away even though he thinks it . ''\nThere is little evidence of that the administration has actually decided to change the way it is fighting the pandemic .\nIn a contentious interview on Fox News Sunday , Trump repeated the untruth that the only reason the US is experiencing more cases is because it increased testing . The administration has clashed with Republican senators who want to fund a new testing and tracing scheme that could slow the spread of the virus .\nTrump 's return to briefings also comes a week after White House officials sought to destroy the reputation of the government 's top infectious disease specialist , Fauci , who unlike the President has been telling the truth that new outbreaks are not embers but a raging nationwide inferno .\nFauci , however , appeared with Vice President Mike Pence on a coronavirus task force call with state governors and asked them to take recommended mitigation efforts to halt the spread of the disease .\nSuspicions that Trump will simply use a new round briefings to perpetuate his lies and false narratives on the pandemic are bolstered by his fresh claims that the United States leads the world in terms of mortality rates . In reality , the US one of the highest death rates from the coronavirus . It does better than the United Kingdom , Spain and Sweden but fares worse than several badly hit countries like Brazil , Mexico and Russia , according to Johns Hopkins University data .\nPerhaps the President will finally absorb such data and take a more serious approach . But the experience of his term so far suggests that he will vastly overstate optimistic data points -- he repeatedly predicted light at the end of the tunnel in his previous round of briefings , for instance . He also used the spotlight to promote what he billed as game changer treatments like hydroxychloroquine , which turned out to be ineffective against the virus .\nTrump 's demand for a full time opening of all schools in the coming weeks also shows how he tends to put his own political interests ahead of scientific assessments and a perception of what might be in the national interests .\nIt is in many ways a repeat of his calamitous call for states to crank up their economies before the science supported the return of bars , restaurants and shopping , especially with many people following the President 's example and spurning the use of face coverings to avoid the spread of infection .\nDespite Trump 's adamant calls for kids to go back to class , the administration has done none preparatory work that might convince parents and teachers that it is safe to do so even as the virus infects tens of thousands of people every day .\nThe consequences of no return to classes are grave , especially for poorer children whose only source of stability and nutrition often comes at school . Abuse at home is often first spotted by teachers . And online learning programs are in many school districts a poor substitute for school .\nSources have told CNN that the President believes that he can play on frustration with continued school closures among suburban voters so far spurning his reelection campaign .\nTrump 's failings were epitomized by his comment in the Fox News Sunday interview when he insisted that Fauci was an `` alarmist '' and that he would `` eventually '' be proven right about the disease even as states break infection records and the death rate rises again .",

        "content": "It 's difficult to keep your distance in a grocery store or pharmacy , so now the CDC says we should wear a homemade mask in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus \u2014 particularly in areas with high community transmission .\nOfficials do n't want healthy people using medical masks because of fears they would buy them all ( kind of like toilet paper ) and not leave them for health care workers .\nThe masks do n't need to be professional-grade to help fight against COVID-19 . According to recent studies , the virus can spread between people in proximity by coughing , sneezing or even speaking .\nIt is important to note that covering your face with a piece of cloth wo n't protect you . But , it could help you from spreading the virus if you 're like some people who lack symptoms and do n't know they have it .\nSewing your own mask is easy , says Jeannette Childers , who \u2019 s 77 and lives in Mesa , Arizona . She \u2019 s among scores of volunteers across the country sewing masks . So far , she \u2019 s made 65 .\n1 . Cut material and interfacing to 12 x 9 inches\n2 . Iron interfacing to material ( adhesive side to back of material )\n3 . Once ironed , fold fabric in half with interfacing on the outside\n4 . Cut two pieces of elastic \u2014 each 7-inches long\n5 . Pin and sew 1/4-inch from edge leaving a 2-inch gap in the center\n6 . Put elastic band on each corner , inside the material and pin to keep in place , making sure the elastic is not twisted . Pinning in center as well\n7 . Using the pattern , mark locations of pleat lines and add pins on both sides\n8 . Fold 3 pleats . Sew around the entire perimeter of the mask , this holds the pleats in place , and closes the 2-inch gap\nAll you have to do is remove the pins , test out your new mask and head out to do your grocery shopping or wherever might make social distancing difficult .\nWhile you \u2019 re at it , make extra to donate . The cloth face coverings recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators , which are critical supplies that must continue to be reserved for health care workers .\nAngelica Jaramillo Harding , a nurse in Mesa , Arizona , picks up donated masks from a Joann fabric and Craft store every Friday to distribute at hospitals , medical centers and clinics . Last week , she gave away 350 of them .\nSince March 23 , Joann stores nationwide have been providing supplies to make masks for free if you donate the finished products . Since then , they \u2019 ve donated more than 16 million . \u201c We \u2019 re definitely touched by the community , \u201d Harding said . \u201c It helps us not to feel alone in this . \u201d",

        "date": "2020-05-22",
        "content": "How to weigh the risk of going out in the coronavirus pandemic , in one chart\nShare All sharing options for : How to weigh the risk of going out in the coronavirus pandemic , in one chart\nSince coronavirus lockdowns began in the US , most Americans have drastically changed their patterns : following instructions to stay home , limiting almost all contact with others , and venturing out only for essential trips and exercise .\nAs states begin to ease social distancing restrictions , people are beginning to have more options . Between those wanting to patronize newly reopened businesses or socialize in person , and more employers calling people back to work , survey and cellphone data suggests people are already starting to trickle out of their homes .\nBut for many people , it \u2019 s really not clear which kinds of gatherings are safe and which aren \u2019 t . And that uncertainty can spark anxiety .\nFortunately , health experts know more about the coronavirus than they did when the lockdowns began , and they can point us to different levels of risk as we begin to reengage . There \u2019 s also advice on how to minimize harm .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been a polarization between two purported options of staying home indefinitely \u2026 versus going back to business as usual , \u201d Julia Marcus , an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard , told me . \u201c The idea of harm reduction gives us a way of thinking about risk as a continuum and thinking about the middle ground between those two options . \u201d\nMarcus and Boston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray created an infographic showing the different scales of risk . We at \u2588\u2588\u2588 were inspired by it and , with Marcus and Murray \u2019 s permission , adapted it :\n\u201c A lot of people , when they hear that you can \u2019 t completely get rid of your risk , they think , \u2018 Well , that means that it \u2019 s inevitable , and I \u2019 ll just go and do everything that I was normally doing before , and if I get sick , I get sick , \u2019 \u201d Murray told me . \u201c But there are lots of things you can do in between nothing and everything . \u201d\nFirst and foremost , the advice that has been repeated for much of the past few months remains true : Your home is still the safest place to be during this pandemic . You should continue trying to stay home as much as possible , because the virus is still circulating at a very high rate in many communities . ( If you want to be extra careful , some resources , like Covid Act Now , help show how much transmission there is in your area . )\nBut whether you need to for work or you \u2019 re simply tired of looking at your home \u2019 s walls , there are ways to mitigate risk when you go out .\nFor one , outdoors is generally safer , thanks to the open air \u2014 where the virus can more easily disperse \u2014 and , potentially , the warm , sunny weather . As Duke health policy expert Mark McClellan told me , \u201c It \u2019 s a good year for outdoor dining and outdoor shopping and outdoor all kinds of activities . \u201d\nIt also matters who you \u2019 re hanging out with . It \u2019 s okay to closely interact with people you live with ( unless one of you gets sick ; then whoever \u2019 s sick should isolate ) . But you should try to keep your distance from people you don \u2019 t live with . And you should try to avoid interacting with too many people at once ; even if it \u2019 s theoretically possible to keep 6 feet from others in a crowded space , it \u2019 s still better to avoid it . That \u2019 s true for the outdoors , but it \u2019 s especially true for the indoors .\nWhen you go out , also take the now-familiar precautions : Wash your hands . Don \u2019 t touch your face . Wear a mask , particularly in indoor public spaces . Avoid shared surfaces and crowded settings , and keep physical distance \u2014 at least 6 feet \u2014 from people you don \u2019 t live with . If you \u2019 re 65 or older or have chronic health conditions that could exacerbate Covid-19 , you should take all of this advice more seriously .\nSeparately , experts say it \u2019 s a good idea to space out trips outside your home as much as possible \u2014 ideally , by two weeks , to match the virus \u2019 s incubation period . You could also establish a \u201c closed circle \u201d with people you want to regularly interact with , in which both sides agree to minimize contact with anyone else ( although some experts are skeptical of this idea ) .\nWith these tips , you can \u2019 t completely eliminate the risk of leaving your home . But you can greatly reduce that risk . For some , that could make the prospects of going out \u2014 with the benefits that going out can entail for your physical and mental health \u2014 much more feasible .\nIt all begins , though , with the understanding that risk during the coronavirus pandemic is really a spectrum , not a black-and-white choice .\n\u201c People will take risks , whether we like it or not , \u201d Marcus said . \u201c The best thing we can do is give them strategies to reduce harm in those situations . If we don \u2019 t do that , we \u2019 re missing an opportunity . \u201d\nFor more detailed tips for going out and the explanations for them , read \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s full explainer .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

        "topic": "Apple And Google Join Forces To Track Your Movements During Coronavirus",
        "date": "",
        "content": "In an effort to help contain the coronavirus pandemic , Tech goliaths Apple and Google have joined together to create software that would assist in contact tracing in order to alert people who have come in contact with people who have contracted COVID-19 .\nSince COVID-19 can be transmitted through close proximity to affected individuals , public health officials have identified contact tracing as a valuable tool to help contain its spread . A number of leading public health authorities , universities , and NGOs around the world have been doing important work to develop opt-in contact tracing technology . To further this cause , Apple and Google will be launching a comprehensive solution that includes application programming interfaces ( APIs ) and operating system-level technology to assist in enabling contact tracing . Given the urgent need , the plan is to implement this solution in two steps while maintaining strong protections around user privacy . First , in May , both companies will release APIs that enable interoperability between Android and iOS devices using apps from public health authorities . These official apps will be available for users to download via their respective app stores . Second , in the coming months , Apple and Google will work to enable a broader Bluetooth-based contact tracing platform by building this functionality into the underlying platforms . This is a more robust solution than an API and would allow more individuals to participate , if they choose to opt in , as well as enable interaction with a broader ecosystem of apps and government health authorities . Privacy , transparency , and consent are of utmost importance in this effort , and we look forward to building this functionality in consultation with interested stakeholders . We will openly publish information about our work for others to analyze .\nHot Air \u2019 s Allahpundit , however , is skeptical about the ability for people to truly \u201c opt out \u201d of this data mining .\n\u201c If I understand that correctly , they \u2019 re going to roll this out quickly by first providing it as an app available for download \u2014 called Contact Tracing , neatly enough . Then , in stage two , they \u2019 re going to build it right into the iOS and Android operating systems while providing some sort of option to opt out . That \u2019 ll deliver the software to three billion people or so , \u201d Allahpundit wrote . \u201c An obvious early question : How thorough will the \u201c opt out \u201d be , exactly ? Given how much personal information is collected surreptitiously by tech companies already , it \u2019 s impossible to believe that the movements of opt-outs won \u2019 t be quietly tracked too . The \u201c opt out \u201d might prevent you from being alerted if someone you \u2019 ve been in contact with is sick , but no one wants to opt out of that part . It \u2019 s the movement tracking to which some will object . Is that realistically preventable once it \u2019 s built into the OS ? Is there any doubt that eventually the default setting on contact tracing will be to turn it on and force users to turn it off ? \u201d\nAllahpundit noted that Apple and Google \u2019 s app looks like it will function at least somewhat like a program that Germany instituted to combat the virus , which broadcasts different IDs every 30 minutes as someone goes about their day . If a person tests positive for coronavirus , then it would trace which IDs came into contact with the temporary IDs of the coronavirus-positive person and send them an alert that they may have interacted with someone who had COVID-19 .\nOf course , as Allahpundit noted , this requires widespread testing for the virus , something we just don \u2019 t have yet .",

Boykin , who has been a social justice advocate longer than she has worked in the emergency department at Sacramento \u2019 s UC Davis Medical Center , soon found herself overcome by tear gas , as well .\n\u201c I think hyper awareness that our lives are literally on the line definitely drew people into the streets , \u201d Boykin said of protesters standing up for an end to police violence \u2014 only to be subjected to police violence themselves . As a protest medic , Boykin said she has seen everything from a protester \u2019 s skull fractured by a police projectile , to abrasions on protesters who have fallen down , while running to avoid being shot or gassed .\nNational Nurses United ( NNU ) is the largest union of registered nurses in the country , representing Boykin and 150,000 other nurses , and these protesters are our patients . It \u2019 s our duty to advocate for their health safety , and that means standing up for racial justice and saying , \u201c Enough ! \u201d to the weapons of war used on people protesting the police violence that has killed George Floyd , Breonna Taylor , and countless others .\nTake tear gas , for example . This chemical weapon has proven fatal in documented cases and is banned in actual warfare , yet it is used liberally by police departments across the country on protesters . It can cause symptoms including vomiting , blurred vision , shortness of breath , tearing , difficulty swallowing , temporary blindness , pain \u2014 and coughing and sneezing . I \u2019 ll say that again for those in the back : It can cause coughing and sneezing during a pandemic when it \u2019 s critical not to spread the virus causing COVID-19 .\nIn addition , to tear gas , militarized police across the country have shown up to recent protests for racial justice and an end to police violence with flashbangs ( also known as stun grenades ) . These weapons have heat exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a blast of 175 decibels and can cause burns , hearing loss , temporary blindness , injuries from shrapnel , and death . Police have also fired rubber bullets , which often have a metal core , and are responsible for deaths , often from the head , neck , and torso trauma \u2014 and internal bleeding , organ damage , and bruising .\nThis is all not to mention other forms of police violence , including kicking , pushing , beating , and kettling protesters , leaving them with no way to escape police violence .\nNurses have seen these violent police tactics before , including during deployments of NNU \u2019 s Registered Nurse Response Network ( RNRN ) to Occupy Wall Street , to Standing Rock , and to the U.S.-Mexico border . At Standing Rock in 2016 , nurses met water protector Vanessa Dundon , whose eye was shot out by a tear gas canister fired by police \u2014 just as Brandon Saenz \u2019 s eye was recently shot out with \u201c less lethal ammunition \u201d at a May 30 Dallas protest , and freelance photographer Linda Tirado \u2019 s eye was shot out by a foam bullet at a May 29 Minneapolis protest .\nAs we connect the lines , nurses can see that police violence against protesters spans calendar years , locations , and protest issues ; it is ubiquitous . As advocates for public health and safety , we call for an end to this violence .\n\u201c What the police are doing is perpetuating a cycle of trauma and abuse that not only costs lives , but it can also \u2026 further perpetuate inequalities and injustices , \u201d said NNU member Heather Honstein , RN , pointing out that chronic stress alone can cause vast negative health impacts for individuals and communities brutalized by the police .\nA cardiovascular surgical ICU nurse at Washington D.C. \u2019 s MedStar Washington Hospital , Honstein was among protesters gathered peacefully in Lafayette square near the White House on June 1 . She left around 6 p.m. , 30 minutes before federal police violently dispersed peaceful crowds , using gas canisters , grenades , and significant force .\nTrapped in her house a few miles away , with low-flying helicopters constantly humming overhead as a \u201c fear tactic , \u201d Honstein wished she could go back out and help more seriously in her capacity as a registered nurse . The next day , she sought out the official medics , already working in an organized way to provide medical help for protesters , and she joined them as a volunteer medic .\nAs nurses , we could never have predicted that we would simultaneously be on the front lines of a pandemic at work , and the front lines of a local battlefield in our free time . But it \u2019 s 2020 , and here we are .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : The only people who come to protests dressed for war are police officers , and their use of force against protesters exercising their constitutional right to assembly is a threat to democracy . It \u2019 s also a colossal waste of public resources that would be far better spent on public health and other social programs that are especially essential in the midst of a pandemic and economic crisis . Nurses know what it takes to keep our patients safe , and violence and so-called \u201c less lethal \u201d weapons of force is not it .\nStanding up for racial justice and the issues that matter should not be lethal in any amount .\nBonnie Castillo , RN , is the executive director of National Nurses United , the largest union of registered nurses in the United States .",

        "content": "Gold futures settled lower on Friday , as traders parsed data showing a loss of more than 20 million U.S. jobs in April tied to efforts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic , but prices for the precious metal ended the week a bit higher .\nThe coronavirus pandemic destroyed 20.5 million U.S. jobs in April , driving the unemployment rate to a post Word War II high of 14.7 % as the country faced its biggest economic crisis in almost a century , according to data from the Labor Department Friday . Still , the loss of jobs was less than the 22.1 million loss forecast of economists surveyed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c It is unexplainable that the shocking headline that the unemployment rate in the United States has climbed to levels not seen since the 1940s has not resulted in a substantial push higher in gold prices \u201d Friday , said Jameel Ahmad , global head of currency strategy and market research at FXTM .\n\u201c It does still appear that the relentless manner in which investors continue to look at very bad economic news as very good news for stock markets is pushing gold prospects back away to sea , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOn Comex , June gold GCM20 , -0.97 % fell by $ 11.90 , or 0.7 % , to settle at $ 1,713.90 an ounce , after spending much of the session seesawing between modest losses and gains .\nMeanwhile , July silver SIN20 , -1.06 % rose 18.8 cents , or 1.2 % , at $ 15.778 an ounce , following a 3.8 % surge in the precious and industrial metal .\nFor the week , the most-active contract for gold saw a weekly rise of almost 0.8 % , while silver futures logged a nearly 6 % advance over the period , according to FactSet data .\nU.S. benchmark stock indexes were higher in Friday dealings as gold futures settled , despite the worst U.S. unemployment rate since the Great Depression .\nA report that top U.S. and China trade negotiators held a telephone call , pledging to create favorable conditions for their phase-one trade deal , helped to bolster appetite for assets considered risky and limit any upside in gold . The call , reported by China \u2019 s state-run Xinhua News Agency , came after President Donald Trump threatened to \u201c terminate \u201d a phase-one Sino-American trade .\nStill , gold has managed to hold above $ 1,700 \u201c in spite of the comeback in risk sentiment \u201d and that shows buying interest in gold continues , said Ahmad .\n\u201c We have now reached a new crossroads in the coronavirus era where governments are attempting to open their economies , and the success they can have in doing this , while keeping the disease outbreak maintained , will be a critical barrier of assessment for where gold prices can go between the next two [ to ] three months , \u201d he said .",

        "content": "President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine a `` game-changer '' in the battle against COVID-19 . While there are n't sufficient clinical studies to prove its effectiveness yet , one Florida man says the anti-malaria drug saved his life .\n`` OK ! I 'm here with my rider Di . We are coming home ! '' said Rio Giardinieri as he was leaving the hospital with his wife .\nWith his wife beside him , Giardinieri drove home late Tuesday night from a hospital in South Florida , calling his survival of COVID-19 nothing short of a miracle .\n`` You go from what you feel is death 's bed to feeling great in 10 hours . To me , call it what you will , but to me , I 'd call it a miracle , '' he said .\nGET YOUR FREE FACTSHEET : Coronavirus : What You Need to Know\nThe Florida-based businessman thinks he got infected with the coronavirus about two weeks ago while attending a conference in New York . Last Friday evening , after 9 days of running a high fever , severe cough , and body aches , doctors told the 52-year-old that there was nothing more they could do to help him . '' )\n`` I did n't think I 'd see Saturday morning , so I made phone calls to family and friends to say my goodbyes , '' Giardinieri explained . `` I very much thought it was my last day on earth . ''\nThat evening a close friend of 43 years told him about hydroxychloroquine , the anti-malaria drug that 's had some success in treating COVID-19 patients overseas .\n`` At that point , I had never even heard of the medicine for hydroxychloroquine , it was totally alien to me , '' Giardinieri said .\nHe consulted with an infectious disease doctor who told him there are sufficient clinical studies to prove hydroxychloroquine 's effectiveness in combating the virus .\n`` My statement to him was simply : ' I do n't think I 'll be here in the morning , so I 'm willing to try anything , '' Giardinieri said .\nLate Friday evening , doctors at Memorial Regional Hospital in South Florida started him on a course of hydroxychloroquine .\n`` And then I woke up at 4:45 in the morning looking right at the clock and it dawned on me all of a sudden that I could breathe , '' he recalled . `` I was pretty amazed and I knew I did n't have a fever . I did n't feel it anymore . '' )\n`` Made it out . Escaped from Alcatraz . Heading home to start my segregation , '' he said as he left the medical facility .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 News spoke to Giardinieri on Wednesday afternoon as he started his quarantine .\n`` I 'm not a scientist , I 'm not a doctor , I do n't have any scientific facts to back it up , I can only tell you that I went to sleep in major pain with a fever for nine days that would n't shake and when I woke up at 4:45 in the morning , I was feeling great . I mean to the point that I felt that I could have gone out on the boat , '' he said .\nInfectious disease experts are trying an array of therapeutic options for fighting COVID-19 .\n`` And what we are finding is that there 's a bunch of different medications , one of which is being the chloroquine that a lot of people have been talking about , that seems to have some effect on this virus and has been used in the past , '' said Dr. Frank Esper , a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children 's Hospital , told The 700 Club on Wednesday\nIn New York , the epicenter of America 's coronavirus outbreak , hospitals started clinical trials with hydroxychloroquine this week in combination with the commonly used Z-Pack .\n`` We have secured 70,000 Hydroxychloroquine , 10,000 Zithromax from the federal government , '' said Gov . Andrew Cuomo ( D-NY ) . `` I want to thank the FDA for moving very expeditiously to get us this supply . ''",

Be the first to hear about Nation Travels destinations , and explore the world with kindred spirits .\nIn this November \u2019 s election , China will be front and center for two reasons . Ad Policy\nFirst , in 2016 , Trump centered his promise to rebalance trade and rebuild American manufacturing\u2014a promise undelivered , with the tariffs mostly punishing American workers\u2014around China . Second , the national security challenges of China \u2019 s preeminence , far from being quarantined in Trump world , are now a concern for most of the world \u2019 s democracies .\nTrump campaigned against China last time , promising to \u201c decouple \u201d the US economy from the emerging superpower , but the coronavirus reveals just how little he has been able to deliver . Tariffs can be needed safeguards for worker adjustment in some industries , and in response to unfair trade policies of specific countries . But they can \u2019 t rebuild America \u2019 s industrial capacity . Because the problem is not just direct imports ; it is the entanglement of complex global supply chains with Chinese sources .\nChina is now the focus of the conversation in part because the coronavirus-induced global supply-chain crisis that is just beginning will make even more people think about our extreme dependence on Chinese manufacturing . It \u2019 s an issue Democrats haven \u2019 t owned , and in some cases have outright dismissed . Coronavirus Prayer Will Not Stop Coronavirus Rev . Dr. William J. Barber II and Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove The 2020 Election in the Time of Pandemic Tom Tomorrow Republican Xenophobia Is Going to Make the Pandemic Much Worse Jeet Heer More in this series\nIt \u2019 s time Democrats start paying attention to the gulf between Sanders and Biden ( and Trump ) on China . Sanders alone has always made building American manufacturing capacity central to his platform : a winning message , and one whose urgency is made all the more clear given the coronavirus .\nJoe Biden , on the other hand , is even worse than Trump on China . Biden \u2019 s policy is : Why bother to worry ? At a campaign rally , Biden dismissed Trump , saying , \u201c China is going to eat our lunch ? Come on , man\u2026they can \u2019 t even figure out how to deal with the fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the east , I mean in the west\u2026 . I mean , you know , they \u2019 re not bad folks , folks . But guess what , they \u2019 re not , they \u2019 re not competition for us . \u201d\nAs a political matter , this shows a remarkable lack of awareness of how workers across the country feel about China . As a factual matter , this is incorrect . In terms of policy , Biden represents the Clinton approach towards trade\u2014an approach that lost America jobs , lost us leverage over the climate crisis , and lost the Democratic Party huge swaths of rank-and-file labor support . Current Issue View our current issue\nSanders \u2019 s approach towards China , on the other hand , fits in with the general approach toward labor and trade that he has championed his entire life . He has been unusually strong in his opposition to the way that trade deals have favored the interests of Wall Street and Big Pharma over workers and Main Street . He saw right from the start the risks of opening up imports from China on World Trade Organization terms and voted against changes in US tariffs that would allow that .\nWhat Sanders alone has been able to articulate is something that most American workers understand , and climate activists get right away : China \u2019 s \u201c competitiveness \u201d is driven by burning coal to the point that its emissions cancel out everyone else \u2019 s efforts to tackle climate change . The current status quo is not fair ; it destroys American productive capacity ; and it is definitely not green . Who benefits ? Offshoring American companies\u2014often through global corporate structures that avoid paying taxes\u2014have benefited from the opening to China ; and so has Wall Street . Deals , deals , deals . They have profited on the backs of American workers , as Sanders has never ceased to point out .\nThis should not be confused with fortress nationalism . Intoxicated by China \u2019 s apparent successes , we have allowed its leaders to define the debate about globalism and nationalism . In fact , regaining innovation-driven manufacturing in America will entail a new globalism , cooperating with partners whether in Europe , or Bangalore , or Guangzho\u2014but driven by a common purpose in greening the economy , not the tax-avoiding exploitative capitalism of offshoring and financialization . This isn \u2019 t just about us ; it \u2019 s about workers and citizens everywhere . If China itself can not shift to a different model of growth and development , China \u2019 s workers along with ours will succumb to the catastrophe of unstoppable climate change\nThe importance of this approach is becoming even more obvious this week , as we see how the trade policy of the past 30 years has radically weakened our ability to respond to a crisis like coronavirus . When American manufacturing capacity is at an all-time low and there are thousands of essential goods that aren \u2019 t manufactured here at all , it makes us vulnerable to huge supply-chain shocks . While Sanders has consistently attacked trade deals that sell workers out and benefit big corporate interests , he , unlike Trump , also sees that protectionism\u2014indiscriminate hikes in tariff barriers\u2014is not the solution . Activist domestic industrial , social , and economic policies are the route to rebuilding America \u2019 s resilience as a great manufacturing country , powered by a proud , productive , and decently rewarded , working class\u2014and key to a robust China policy .\nWhen key imports are all sourced internationally , it increases the risk of supply-chain disruptions . If a large percentage of any product , or any ingredient in a product\u2014be that a ball bearing or a chemical or a charger\u2014comes from a region in China that is quarantined , all the products that depend on that ingredient get stuck without replacement . On the other hand , if manufacturing were dispersed throughout both the United States and other countries , we would be ready for crises because we could quickly ramp up production in the American facilities , with governmental support .\nTrump \u2019 s failures prove the fragility of the current system can \u2019 t be fixed by punishing imports at the border . Global supply-chain networks are notoriously complicated ; many distributors have no idea about the status of their upstream suppliers\u2014where they are located , how many alternative sources exist , how much product is stockpiled . Only in an emergency is the fragility of the chain revealed .\nFor instance , when a major earthquake hit Japan in 2011 , it took a while before auto factories\u2014who bought their paints from suppliers\u2014realized that the only factory in the world that made a paint pigment required for black paint had been hit by the earthquake . The world was a slightly cheerier place with fewer black cars for a while , but the coronavirus is operating like a rolling earthquake , shutting down operations as quarantines get imposed around the globe , and because downstream suppliers don \u2019 t know their upstream sources , we don \u2019 t know exactly where all the shortages will pop up , and how severe they will be .\nUncertainty and complexity and lack of transparency in supply chains makes it all the more important to have strong domestic manufacturing capacity\u2014productive capacity\u2014across the board . The coronavirus is not a drill : We need this kind of investment right now . But you can \u2019 t get it just by propping up Wall Street .\nHow would a Sanders presidency address this ? Rebuilding our domestic manufacturing capacity in the short term with massive public investment , through sovereign wealth funds or other vehicles , like public/private partnerships . In other words , a New Deal level investment . Even if we didn \u2019 t already need a Green New Deal , we would need a New Deal for the coronavirus ( or any pandemic ) . Because of his long track record of championing exactly this kind of approach , Sanders has the unique credibility and conviction to spearhead such a project .\nWe don \u2019 t know where we will be with the coronavirus when a President Sanders would take the helm , but all signs point to a long struggle against this pandemic , and to the certainty that other such shocks are sure to come .\nWhether it is Trump on the coronavirus or Biden on China , \u201c Don \u2019 t worry \u201d is a fatal strategy in the midst of a crisis . Living in denial , or living in the past , has never served America , and ill-serves the world .",

        "topic": "Sanders suspends presidential campaign, rendering Biden presumptive Democratic nominee",
        "date": "",
        "content": "Bernie Sanders suspended his Democratic presidential campaign on Wednesday , effectively ensuring former Vice President Joe Biden will be the party 's nominee even as the liberal Vermont senator vowed to continue to lead his `` movement '' into the future .\nThe senator , at one point the front-runner for the nomination , initially announced the decision during an all-staff conference call Wednesday morning , and followed up with an address livestreamed to supporters shortly before noon .\nCiting Biden \u2019 s lead of more than 300 convention delegates , Sanders declared : \u201c The path toward victory is virtually impossible . \u201d\nHe continued : \u201c I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful . ... I do not make this decision lightly . \u201d\nHe still claimed a symbolic victory in saying `` our movement has won the ideological struggle \u201d -- discussing how core ideas like a $ 15 minimum wage , health care for all and more have been more widely embraced in the party .\nIn a curious moment , though , Sanders said that Biden `` will be the nominee , '' yet went on to stress the importance of continuing to win delegates for his own campaign so he 'll be able to exert `` influence '' on the party platform .\nCalling it a `` difficult and painful decision , '' Sanders stressed that `` while this campaign is coming to an end , our movement is not . ''\nMore than any other Democratic campaign , Sanders ' candidacy indeed represented a movement -- a populist , liberal , grassroots army of young people and others drawn to his democratic socialist beliefs , which he brought from the fringes to the mainstream of the party .\nBiden , now the presumptive nominee , said in a statement that Sanders and his supporters `` changed the dialogue . ''\nHe said : `` But more than any one issue or set of issues , I want to commend Bernie for being a powerful voice for a fairer and more just America . It \u2019 s voices like Bernie \u2019 s that refuse to allow us to just accept what is \u2014 that refuse to accept we can \u2019 t change what \u2019 s wrong in our nation \u2014 that refuse to accept the health and well-being of our fellow citizens and our planet isn \u2019 t our responsibility too . Bernie gets a lot of credit for his passionate advocacy for the issues he cares about . But he doesn \u2019 t get enough credit for being a voice that forces us all to take a hard look in the mirror and ask if we \u2019 ve done enough . ''\nFox News has confirmed that Biden and Sanders have since spoken .\n`` I know Bernie well . He \u2019 s a good man , a great leader , and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country . And it \u2019 s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one , single tweet . So I won \u2019 t try to , '' Biden tweeted .\n\u201c To Bernie and Jane , as friends , from Jill and me : You haven \u2019 t just run a political campaign ; you \u2019 ve created a movement . And make no mistake about it , we believe it \u2019 s a movement that is as powerful today as it was yesterday . That \u2019 s a good thing for our nation and our future . ''\nFor a time , Sanders almost looked poised to clinch the nomination , as he and a handful of others emerged in early 2020 as the last candidates standing from a once-massive field of primary contenders .\nSanders won New Hampshire 's primary and scored a landslide victory in the Nevada caucuses in late February , as he surged to front-runner status in the nomination race .\nThe populist lawmaker , however , then suffered a string of major primary defeats in his second straight presidential bid .\nBiden steadily amassed a near-insurmountable delegate lead , following decisive victories in South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday as well as subsequent contests -- before coronavirus measures forced most primaries on the calendar to be delayed .\nBut until now , Sanders had refused to back out of the race , instead pressing Biden to embrace progressive policy positions . Sanders ' lingering presence in the race had agitated Biden allies , concerned he would continue to make it difficult for Biden to fully focus on a general election battle against President Trump .\nBiden , however , was already moving ahead , planning to consider running mates and even downplaying the possibility of any future debates with Sanders as part of the primary process .\nThe most recent primary was held Tuesday in Wisconsin , though most others are postponed . Results in that race are not expected for another week , though Biden was thought to have the clear advantage there .\nBiden \u2019 s path to the nomination was already clearing , thanks to not only his delegate lead but support from much of the party establishment and former primary rivals . One prominent figure still has not formally endorsed Biden , however \u2013 former President Barack Obama .\nObama and Sanders spoke multiple times the past few weeks \u2013 as the senator from Vermont mulled the future of his White House bid \u2013 a source close to Obama \u2019 s orbit confirmed to Fox News .\n\u201c [ H ] e \u2019 s had multiple conversations with candidates , including Senator Sanders , about how to best position the Democratic Party to win in November . While the content of those conversations remain private , there was always agreement that winning in the fall was paramount , \u201d the source said .\nSanders on Wednesday blasted Trump as the `` most dangerous president '' in modern American history .\nIn a statement , Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale took renewed swipes at Biden : `` With Bernie Sanders suspending his campaign , it \u2019 s all but official that the Democrat establishment got the candidate they wanted in Joe Biden , as well as the candidate President Trump will destroy in November . President Trump is still disrupting Washington , DC , while Biden represents the old , tired way and continuing to coddle the communist regime in China . Democrat elites shoved Bernie Sanders to the side for a second time , leaving many of his supporters looking for a new home . \u201d\nSanders was considered the longest of long-shots when he launched his first White House bid in the spring of 2015 . But after nearly defeating Hillary Clinton in the Iowa caucuses and then crushing the former secretary of state in the New Hampshire primary , he battled the eventual nominee throughout the primary calendar .\nHe made an uneasy peace with Clinton in the summer of 2016 , but many of his progressive and younger supporters never embraced the Democratic nominee . The lack of unity was a contributing factor in helping Donald Trump upset Clinton .\nThere are deep concerns among Democrats of a repeat of the 2016 lack of unity . Biden has praised Sanders in recent weeks and has said he would not pressure the senator to drop out of the race .\nBiden has also embraced some progressive proposals , such as bankruptcy reform and free college tuition at public colleges and universities -- policies that Sanders had pushed . But he has not embraced `` Medicare-for-all , '' Sanders ' signature policy that has many supporters among congressional Democrats .",

        "content": "Members of the Senate Banking Committee squabbled Tuesday over how quickly the U.S. economy can rebound from the coronavirus shutdown and whether the federal government is doing enough to support struggling families and businesses in the meantime .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell defended the government 's multi-trillion-dollar relief efforts to date . Powell stressed additional measures may be necessary to prevent lasting economic damage .\nThe challenges of reopening parts of the economy were underscored by the hearing 's format . It was held virtually , with both witnesses and senators on videoconference , though Mnuchin said he would have been willing to testify in person .\nOhio Sen. Sherrod Brown , the ranking Democrat on the committee , accused the Trump administration of pushing businesses to reopen prematurely , without adequate safeguards for workers .\n`` How many workers should give their lives to increase our GDP by half a percent ? '' Brown asked .\nSen. Pat Toomey , R-Pa. , countered : `` The longer that we continue a shutdown \u2014 when weeks turn into months \u2014 does n't that necessarily increase the risk that some businesses will fail , some jobs wo n't be there to go back to ? ''\nMnuchin and Powell said the Fed 's emergency lending programs for midsize businesses and for state and local governments should be up and running by the end of this month .\nSen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , complained that those programs \u2014 authorized by Congress with some $ 450 billion in seed money \u2014 do not including binding requirements that loan recipients keep workers on the payroll .\n`` We 're in a situation where 35 million Americans have filed for unemployment , '' Warren said . `` You 're in charge of half a trillion dollars . You 're boosting your Wall Street buddies and you are leaving Americans behind . ''\nMnuchin disputed that characterization and said the terms of the lending programs had been negotiated with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress .\nThe treasury secretary also said the government is willing to take some risks in financing the emergency loans .\n`` We are fully prepared to take losses in certain scenarios , '' Mnuchin said .\nPowell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional relief spending to keep families , businesses and cash-strapped state and local governments afloat until the virus is under control .\n`` What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful , '' the Fed chairman said . `` I do think we need to take a step back and ask , over time , is it enough ? And we need to be prepared to act further . ''\nIn addition to the Fed 's lending programs , the government has made hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to small businesses , which can be forgiven so long as most of the money is used for payroll . Mnuchin said he 's eager to work with lawmakers to give borrowers in that program more flexibility .",

        "content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) told Fox News on Monday evening that would not close America \u2019 s borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus .\nDuring a town hall on Monday evening , was asked what he would do differently from Trump to protect Americans from the rapid spread of the illness , which originated in Wuhan , China ..\nWhen anchor Bret Baier asked \u201c would you close down the borders \u201d stop a coronavirus outbreak , Sanders responded \u201c No. \u201d The exchange went as follows :\nBret Baier : If you had to , would you close down the borders ? Bernie Sanders : No . What you don \u2019 t want to do right now when you have a president who has propagated xenophobic , anti-immigrant sentiment from before he was elected . What we need to do is have the scientists take a hard look at what we need to do . There are communities where the virus is spreading . What does that mean ? It may mean self-quarantine , maybe not having public assemblies . But let \u2019 s not go back to the same old thing . Isn \u2019 t it interesting that a president who has been demagoguing and demonizing immigrants , the first thing that he can think about is closing down the border . So we need scientists to tell us the appropriate approach , not a political approach .\nSanders \u2019 comments actually contrast with the conclusions of doctors and scientists . The New England Journal of Medicine recently reported : \u201c At least on a temporary basis , such restrictions may have helped slow the spread of the virus . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump administration has implemented travel bans on China and Iran , two of the most coronavirus-affected nations in the world , over the early objections of his critics .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) denounced Trump \u2019 s travel ban to protect Americans from the coronavirus , claiming travel bans \u201c do more harm than good . \u201d\nJohn Binder is a reporter for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
