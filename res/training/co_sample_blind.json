        "content": "Parents already overwhelmed by the challenges of raising kids amid a global pandemic now have something else to worry about : a mysterious inflammatory disease most evident in New York \u2013 the nation \u2019 s coronavirus epicenter \u2013 but also popping up elsewhere .\nIt \u2019 s too early to tell how big a concern it will become , but the illness came up during a Senate hearing Tuesday when Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus task force warned against rushing to reopen schools in the fall . He referenced \u201c children presenting with COVID-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome , very similar to Kawasaki syndrome . ''\n\u201c I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects ( of the virus ) . \u2019 \u2019\nDoctors are calling the new ailment pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome , and it shares some traits with Kawasaki , which typically afflicts children under 5 years old . Their common symptoms : prolonged fever , a rash , conjunctivitis , swelling of the palms or soles of the feet , sometimes peeling of the skin in those areas and lymph node enlargement .\nIs there a link ? More kids fall ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease as officials test for coronavirus\nOn Tuesday , New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo said the state is investigating about 100 possible cases of the new disease , which has killed at least three and has also been spotted in Los Angeles , the San Francisco Bay Area ( suspected ) , Chicago , Britain and Spain .\nDr. Charles Schleien , chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York , said his hospital has seen about 40 cases since mid-April and the majority showed antibodies similar to the coronavirus , meaning they had been infected , but had no symptoms of COVID-19 . Several others tested positive for the virus and didn \u2019 t have symptoms either .\nThough a causal connection between the virus and the new illness has yet to be proven , \u201c The relationship seems pretty strong , \u2019 \u2019 Schleien said .\n\u201c First of all , we never see these many kids with Kawasaki . Usually we \u2019 ll see a few kids a year . We won \u2019 t see three dozen over a period of a few weeks . So , given the numbers and given the fact it \u2019 s not acting exactly like Kawasaki , it looks like it \u2019 s probably a post-COVID-19 infection inflammatory disease . \u2019 \u2019\nOne difference from Kawasaki , which develops in about one in every 10,000 American children under 5 every year , is the age range for this disease stretches into adolescence . Schleien said he has seen it in minors as old as 14 .\nOne fortuitous similarity , though , is that both can be treated effectively , usually with intravenous immunoglobulin and sometimes steroids , followed by aspirin . Hospital stays for patients may last two to four days . Parents are advised to check with a physician or take their children to an emergency room if their fever persists for more than two to three days , especially if some of the other symptoms appear , including a rapid heartbeat .\n\u201c The good news is that , like Kawasaki disease , almost all the kids are treatable , \u2019 \u2019 Schleien said . \u201c It is highly likely that , with treatment , they \u2019 re going to be fine . It \u2019 s not like the fear of COVID-19 where we know there are no treatments and it \u2019 s a matter of luck . \u2019 \u2019\nBut the apparent link between the two raises concerns , and it \u2019 s reasonable to expect more cases to be identified at other COVID-19 hot spots now that there \u2019 s more awareness of the inflammatory syndrome .\nRelated : More kids fall ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease as officials test for coronavirus\nMore:3 children have died in New York from a coronavirus-linked inflammatory disease , Cuomo says\nSchleien said the illness has become such a hot topic among New York-area pediatricians that when his hospital hosted a video call to discuss it , more than 600 logged on and the website crashed .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it \u2019 s studying the rare disease and does not have statistics about its incidence .\n\u201c As more data are emerging , CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and other domestic and international partners to better understand and characterize this new syndrome , its prevalence and risk factors for it ; and to develop a case definition that will allow us to keep track of it , \u2019 \u2019 the agency said through a spokesman .\nOn Wednesday , the CDC confirmed it plans to send out an alert in the next couple of days telling doctors to be on the lookout for the syndrome .\nThe children \u2019 s hospital next to the Stanford University campus , about 35 miles south of San Francisco , may have discovered the first case of the new disease in a 6-month-old baby who was initially diagnosed with Kawasaki , then tested positive for the coronavirus March 16 .\nDr. Yvonne Maldonado , a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the university , hosted a webinar that addressed the case on Friday as scientists try to find out whether the virus precipitates the syndrome .\n\u201c The question is , will this be something to look out for in children over time ? \u2019 \u2019 she said . \u201c It may be that it \u2019 s another inflammatory reaction , like we \u2019 re seeing in adults who have inflammation of their lungs . It seems like this virus triggers in some people a really intense inflammatory response . \u2019 \u2019\nA nationwide view : See how the outbreak spread across the US\nResearchers from the U.K. , where a few dozen cases of the syndrome have been reported , participated in the webinar and pointed out that the few children who had COVID-19 symptoms did not show signs of the new disease .\nHowever , children who remained asymptomatic despite being in a family with several infected and sick members developed the inflammatory response a week or two later .\nThrough the haze of uncertainty still surrounding the coronavirus and its offshoots , Maldonado wants to appease parents while reminding them to practice social distancing and encourage it on their children . And she has these messages about the new syndrome :\n\u201c We have to do two things , \u2019 \u2019 she said . \u201c We have to reassure people that it \u2019 s very rare . And at the same time , we need to make people aware this is not a made-up disease . This is real . \u2019 \u2019",

        "content": "More than a third of U.S. states reported record highs in average new Covid-19 cases as deaths across the U.S. gradually rise , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University . Across the U.S. , 19 states saw new cases reach daily records on Sunday , based on an average over the previous seven days , according to the data . That includes Texas , Georgia and Florida , the last of which reported a shattering 15,300 new cases on Sunday . \u2588\u2588\u2588 uses a seven-day trailing average to smooth out spikes in data reporting to identify where cases are rising and falling . The United States was one of two countries that accounted for about half of the new daily coronavirus cases reported across the globe , the World Health Organization said Monday . The U.S. and Brazil reported 111,319 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday . `` Let me be blunt , too many countries are headed in the wrong direction , '' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news conference from the agency 's Geneva headquarters .\nMeanwhile , the number of coronavirus-related deaths is on the rise in a handful of states , including Texas , Florida and Arizona . Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. have declined or remained relatively stable for weeks , even though cases have more than doubled since mid-May . After peaking at an average of more than 2,000 deaths per day just three months ago , primarily driven by New York and New Jersey , fatalities in the U.S. have been slowly declining \u2014 falling to an average of less than 600 fatalities a day from June 23 through July 8 . But the daily death toll appears to be on the rise again in the U.S. , epidemiologists say . As of Sunday , the U.S. is averaging just over 700 new deaths a day .\nArizona has reported an average of about 59 new coronavirus-related deaths per day over the past seven days as of Sunday , up more than 78 % compared with a week ago , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 's analysis of data compiled by Hopkins . Coronavirus-related deaths in Texas surged 140 % from last week to an average of about 82 deaths per day over the past seven days as of Sunday , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 's analysis of data compiled by Hopkins .",

        "content": "( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - The United States is preparing to issue guidance on reducing \u201c unnecessary \u201d testing for COVID-19 as it works to cut turnaround times for tests , a senior U.S. health official said on Thursday .\nDetails of the guidance are still being hammered out but it would be aimed partly at discouraging COVID-19 patients who have completed home quarantine from getting retested before returning to work or school , said Brett Giroir , assistant secretary for health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services .\nSpeaking on a call with reporters , he said such unnecessary tests were \u201c clogging up the system . \u201d\n\u201c You do not need to be retested unless you are a critically ill person in the hospital or a very unusual case with immune suppression in which case you could shed virus for longer than seven or eight days , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Turnaround times continue to be an issue \u201d for COVID-19 tests , he added , saying he would like to see the average get down to three days . Currently , only 26 states are taking three days or less to produce test results , with one state taking more than five days .\nThe new guidance on testing is \u201c not a result of shortages , \u201d Girior added , but rather because such tests are not needed .\nThe U.S. government is trying to facilitate a transition away from lab-based tests , which can have longer turnaround times , to point-of-care tests , which can provide results in minutes and be conducted in a wider variety of locations .\nThe U.S. government expects there will be 20 million point-of-care tests per month available by September , Girior said .\nBecton Dickinson on Wednesday said the U.S. government agreed to buy 750,000 of its point-of-care tests .",

        "topic": "Coronavirus makes it more clear than ever: Health care is a human right",
        "date": "2020-03-30",
        "content": "For months that question was used as a weapon against supporters of Medicare for All . Now , it is on everyone \u2019 s mind as they worry about the costs of the testing and treatment for the coronavirus . The virus is highly contagious . We need everyone with symptoms to get tested and all with the virus to get treatment . If anyone hesitates because they fear they can \u2019 t afford the cost , they put the rest of us at risk .\nNo one should be worried about the costs of treatment .\nColumnists In-depth political coverage , sports analysis , entertainment reviews and cultural commentary .\nThose costs , however , are going to be staggering , particularly if the fears of the administration \u2019 s leading expert , Dr. Anthony Fauci , are realized and a million or more may become infected with the disease . Hospitalization and treatment will cost hundreds of billions . The average cost of hospitalization for pneumonia patients is about $ 20,000 , but many coronavirus patients tend to need to stay on ventilators longer and fight off more complications than pneumonia patients .\nAcross the country , Americans are terrified at the potential costs if they get sick . Twenty-seven million Americans have no health insurance at all . Four in 10 working Americans have a high-deductible plan that forces them to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket before they get benefit from the premiums taken out of their paychecks each week .\nA 2009 Harvard Medical School study estimated that every year an estimated 45,000 people in the U.S. die because of lack of health care coverage . Many suffer because they put off necessary treatment because they can \u2019 t afford it . Now , as Rep. Ro Khanna , D-Cal. , put it , \u201c The reality is , there are a lot of people that are thinking , \u2018 I don \u2019 t want a couple thousand-dollar bill to get tested or get treated . \u2019 \u201d\nThe rescue bill just passed by Congress covers the costs of testing . Trump promised that any cost of treatment also would be covered , but the insurance lobby immediately corrected him . Since then , under immense pressure , Cigna and Humana have joined CVS Aetna insurance in agreeing to waive patient cost-sharing on treatment for those insured .\nHopefully , this will reassure people enough that they won \u2019 t avoid getting tested and treated , posing the threat to all . But this won \u2019 t be charity . Some health-care analysts think the insurance industry could benefit from the pandemic because people generally are putting off visits to doctors and hospitals as much as possible .\nIn any case , insurers admit that if the costs soar they will factor it into the cost of plans next year . As Peter Lee , the head of Covered California , an independent state agency , noted , insurers are likely to seek rates next year that are double their additional costs from the virus . If costs go up 20 percent , rates could jump as much as 40 percent . That could mean , Lee warned \u201c that many of the 170 million Americans in the commercial market may lose their coverage and go without needed care . \u201d\nThe insurers will sustain their profits ; it \u2019 s the patients who will suffer .\nThe government is investing billions of dollars to develop a vaccine for the virus , and to develop other drugs that can help treat it . Yet , because the government turns over any drug developed to the private pharmaceutical companies , Health Secretary Alex Azar \u2014 a former lobbyist for the drug companies \u2014 said he couldn \u2019 t guarantee that the treatments would be affordable . Already , as the Intercept reported , bankers are goading drug companies to prepare to raise prices to benefit from the expected demand .\nThe U.S. spends about twice as much per capita for its patchwork health-care system than most industrialized countries . Why were we caught with such shortages of masks , ventilators or hospital beds ?\nA central reason is that about $ 500 billion of what we spend on health care each year doesn \u2019 t go to health care . It is wasted on costly bureaucracies needed to bill the maze of private insurers or track down patients for their co-pays . It goes to hundreds of billions in profits for insurance companies and drug companies . It goes to excessive CEO salaries rising to $ 80 million or so a year .\nIn the end , the federal government will and should step up to cover the costs of all testing and treatment for the pandemic . It will have to reimburse states to cover soaring Medicaid and hospital costs . It will pay for developing the necessary drugs . It will pay for the costs of covering seniors under Medicare . It will pay for the costs incurred by those without insurance or with employer-based insurance . Yet , in part because of this , the insurance companies and drug companies will keep racking up record profits .\nAt this point , the overriding imperative is that every person in the U.S. understand that they should get the testing and treatment they need . All should be reassured that their costs will be covered . Congress went part of the way with the last rescue package . It should finish the job , preferably by having Medicare pay for all the costs directly .\nBut we shouldn \u2019 t be satisfied with single-payer coverage just during a massive pandemic . This crisis exposes dramatically the foolishness of pretending that health care is a private marketplace . Health care is a human right . This pandemic gives ample evidence of why we need to move to a Medicare for All system where high-quality health care is guaranteed to all .",

        "date": "",
        "content": "Italy has placed up to 16 million people under quarantine as it battles to contain the spread of coronavirus .\nAnyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces will need special permission to travel . Milan and Venice are both affected .\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte also announced the closure of schools , gyms , museums , nightclubs and other venues across the whole country .\nThe measures , the most radical taken outside China , will last until 3 April .\nItaly has seen the largest number of coronavirus infections in Europe , with the number of confirmed cases jumping by more than 1,200 to 5,883 on Saturday .\nAmong the latest people to test positive is the army 's chief of staff . Salvatore Farina said he felt well and was self-isolating .\nThe strict new quarantine measures affect a quarter of the Italian population and centre on the rich northern part of the country that powers its economy .\nThe death toll in Italy has passed 230 , with officials reporting more than 36 deaths in 24 hours .\nThe health system is under immense strain in Lombardy , a northern region of 10 million people , where people are being treated in hospital corridors .\n`` We want to guarantee the health of our citizens . We understand that these measures will impose sacrifices , sometimes small and sometimes very big , '' Prime Minister Conte said as he announced the measures in the middle of the night .\nUnder the new measures , people are not supposed to be able to enter or leave Lombardy , where Milan is the main city .\nThe same restrictions apply to 14 provinces : Modena , Parma , Piacenza , Reggio Emilia , Rimini , Pesaro and Urbino , Alessandria , Asti , Novara , Verbano Cusio Ossola , Vercelli , Padua , Treviso and Venice .\n`` There will be no movement in or out of these areas , or within them , unless for proven work-related reasons , emergencies or health reasons , '' Mr Conte told reporters .\n`` We are facing an emergency , a national emergency . We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed . ''\nSome transport in and out of the regions affected continued on Sunday . Flights continued to arrive at Milan 's Malpensa and Linate airports , though some scheduled flights were cancelled .\nHowever , Italy 's national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend all operations from Malpensa from Monday and Linate would only serve domestic routes . International flights would continue to and from Rome .\nChris Wood , a 26-year-old from London said he and his girlfriend had cut their holiday in Italy short and were waiting for a flight home from Venice .\n`` The initial announcement that Venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm , '' he said . `` I was in a bit of a panic as I thought we were going to be stuck in Venice for a month . ''\nLast week was critical to seeing if Italy 's coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread . If the numbers had begun to tail off , it would have suggested the containment measures had worked . They have n't .\nWith cases still surging , the government has moved to the next stage - and it 's a dramatic step up . It 's not quite a complete lockdown - planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons . But police will be able to stop people and ask why they 're trying to enter or leave the areas covered .\nThe question is whether this is all too late . It 's believed the virus was circulating in Italy for weeks before it was detected . And there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country . The government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of China . But is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted ?\nWeddings and funerals have been suspended , as well as religious and cultural events . Cinemas , nightclubs , gyms , swimming pools , museums and ski resorts have been closed .\nRestaurants and cafes in the quarantined zones can open between 06:00 and 18:00 but customers must sit at least 1m ( 3ft ) apart .\nPeople have been told to stay at home as much as possible , and those who break the quarantine could face three months in jail .\nThe World Health Organization ( WHO ) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised Italy for making `` genuine sacrifices '' with the restrictions . Until now only about 50,000 people in northern Italy had been affected by quarantines .\nLast week the government announced the closure of all schools and universities across the country for 10 days .\nThe number of infections worldwide is more than 105,500 , the WHO says , with nearly 3,600 deaths . Most of the fatalities have been in China , where the virus originated in December .\nBut the country on Sunday reported its lowest number of new infections in a single day since January - an indication that the virus 's spread there is slowing .\nThere were 40 new cases on Saturday , less than half the number reported on Friday . Twenty-seven new deaths were reported - the lowest figure in more than a month - and all were in Wuhan , where the outbreak began .\nIran , one of the worst hotspots outside China , has now confirmed almost 6,000 infections and 145 deaths .\nHowever , the real figure is believed to be much higher . One report on Sunday , quoting a government envoy , said there had been 200 deaths in the northern Gilan province alone - but the figures were later removed .\nSaudi Arabia has put the governorate of Qatif in the oil-producing Eastern Province into lockdown . The cases confirmed in Qatif - where the Shia minority live - have all been traced back to Iran\nA hotel being used as a coronavirus quarantine facility in the Chinese city of Quanzhou collapsed , killing at least six people\nPope Francis delivered his first live-streamed Sunday prayer to avoid the usual crowds forming - he said he was `` close through prayer '' with those suffering from the epidemic\nIn the US , a cruise ship with 3,533 passengers and crew held off the coast near San Francisco after 21 people tested positive for the disease has been directed to the nearby port of Oakland\nAn individual who attended a conservative political conference last week that President Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence spoke at has been confirmed to have the virus\nOn Sunday South Korean officials said 272 new cases had been reported over the previous 24 hours , bringing the total to 7,313 - the largest of any country outside China .\nIn the US more than 400 cases have been reported , and the death toll is 19 .\nIn New York , cases jumped from 44 on Friday to 76 and Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency .\nSouth America recorded its first coronavirus death - a 64-year-old man in Argentina .\nIn Australia , a man in his 80s became the third person to die there from the virus .\nAmong other countries to report a rise in the total number of cases are : France ( to 1,126 ) ; Germany ( 939 ) ; Spain ( 589 ) ; the UK ( 273 ) ; the Netherlands ( 188 ) .\nColombia , Bulgaria , Costa Rica , Malta , the Maldives and Paraguay have , meanwhile , all reported their first cases .\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist .

        "date": "2020-04-10",
        "content": "The U.S. stock market has had an extraordinary week , with the broad S & P 500 index rising nearly 12 percent since Monday . Investors seem to believe that the actions of the Federal Reserve in particular \u2014 which announced a new $ 2.3 trillion effort to support local governments and small- to mid-sized businesses \u2014 will substantially limit the economic damage caused by shelter-in-place orders and other physical-distancing efforts to combat the virus , and set the economy up for a quick rebound once the crisis is over .\nAre they right ? It 's impossible to know . That very uncertainty is a major reason why the Fed 's program , along with other government interventions to maintain payrolls and otherwise freeze the economy in place are a good idea . But the ultimate economic cost will be determined by the virus itself .\nConsider the following thought experiment . Suppose , for the sake of argument , that we knew that a safe and reliable cure for the novel coronavirus would be coming to market in six weeks , and that the drug was going to be distributed in massive quantities all over the country and indeed the world .\nIn that case , investors , business-owners and workers would all know with reasonable precision what they needed to do to weather the storm . All along the chain of economic activity , payments \u2014 rent to landlords , interest on loans , salaries to employees , bills to utilities \u2014 would need to be deferred for six weeks , after which the economy could simply open up again for business as usual . The government would still have a key role to play in cushioning the blow , particularly for employees at the end of the economic chain , and in coordinating economy-wide collective action , but the problem would mostly be a technical one .\nThat is not the world we live in . In fact , while there are a number of promising treatments being investigated , we have no real assurance that they will pan out , nor do we know how long they will take to get to market if they do . Similarly , the timeline for an effective vaccine is unknown . And in the meantime , we do n't know how much the economy will be able to open up without triggering new outbreaks , and how the shape of the economy will fundamentally need to change to adapt to the new semi-normal that follows the current pause .\nThat massive uncertainty is a huge economic drag \u2014 and is a far more important one than the pause itself . No business can plan financially for a completely unknown economic environment . Nor can any investor . The rational thing to do in such circumstances is simply to hoard cash \u2014 which is precisely how you get a depression .\nThe Fed 's interventions are aimed at preventing that from happening . Some of what the Fed is doing is familiar ; massive injections of liquidity lower the attractiveness of holding cash , luring money back into risky assets . But the massive lending to small businesses and local governments is very much not normal , but a necessary response to a very abnormal situation where the government deliberately shuts down the economy for a period of time . The objective is to discourage those entities from tightening their belts \u2014 not to shutter operations or lay off employees \u2014 and help them simply wait out the current pause .\nThey 're not just waiting out the current pause , though ; they 're waiting out the period of uncertainty . In a month or two , everyone will have a much better idea of what the economy is going to look like for an extended period until a cure and/or a vaccine comes available . We 'll know which businesses just are n't going to be viable , and which are going to be able to adapt . And that applies not only to businesses but to entire industries , from restaurants to commercial aviation .\nThat 's the tricky part . The federal government is basically paying everyone not to do too much planning during this period of extreme uncertainty , but to keep existing arrangements frozen in place as much as possible . That 's the right call right now ; if everyone tried to protect themselves in a situation of such high uncertainty , the collective cost would be shattering . Eventually , though , that planning has to happen \u2014 and that will necessitate real economic dislocations , potentially profound ones .\nMoreover , we actually want those transitions to happen . We do n't want the government 's role to be propping up businesses and industries that are not viable in a post-COVID-19 world . Rather , we want it to focus on cushioning the social cost of shifting both capital and labor into roles where they can contribute productively . Think of it as the transition from being in the ICU , where machines are keeping you alive and you 're just waiting for your body to heal , to emerging into rehab , where you have to learn new habits to regain function .\nThat 's going to be a delicate transition for the economy to navigate , both politically and economically .

        "topic": "Gyms Are Reopening, But Is it Safe to Go Back?",
        "date": "",
        "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its website to emphasize that touching contaminated surfaces does not appear to be a main way the virus spreads . Even so , gyms are taking precautions , from purchasing electrostatic sprayers to ensure every millimeter of surface area is disinfected to getting rid of porous equipment such as foam rollers .\nSome of the key changes gyms across the country are making to minimize risk include :\nNearly all gyms have implemented a touch-free check-in process and some are enforcing temperature scans . Cooper Fitness Centers has one of the most thorough check-in protocols . Before being allowed to enter the club , members must now answer questions including : \u201c Are you experiencing any flulike symptoms ? Is anyone in your household currently under COVID-19 quarantine ? \u201d They then have their temperature taken and are given a wristband to signal to staffers they passed the health screening .\nMedical experts believe the virus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs , sneezes or talks . Nearly all gyms are mandating that staff wear face masks and gloves . Instead of masks , spin instructors are wearing clear face shields that better accommodate microphones while still providing a barrier of protection . Members are not required to wear masks , though Zwiefel estimates 1 in 10 returning Life Time members do .\nDavid Flench , director of Hancock Wellness Center , a medically integrated fitness center in Greenfield , Ind. , says their gym has decided not to require anyone doing vigorous exercise to wear a mask , based on the opinion of Hancock Health 's medical director . People doing low-impact exercise are encouraged to wear one .\nGyms are strictly implementing the CDC 's suggested 6 feet of social distancing by spacing out everything from cardio equipment to lockers and encouraging members to share a thumbs up instead of a high five . Crunch Fitness staff held trial runs of socially distanced group fitness classes to ensure that floor graphics kept people 6 to 8 feet apart .\nGyms have shut down contact sports like basketball and those that have opened pools are limiting usage to single-lane swimming . A handful of facilities have resumed personal training , but are ensuring social distancing by replacing hands-on adjustments with verbal cues . Hancock Wellness Center has even appointed room ambassadors to go around the facility and ensure physical distancing .\nA number of gyms have decided to continue solely with virtual group fitness classes in phase one of reopening . Facilities resuming in-person classes have scaled back the number of participants to ensure physical distancing . Signing up in advance is highly recommended and , in some cases , required .",

        "topic": "Dire projections put new focus on Trump coronavirus response",
        "date": "2020-04-02",
        "content": "Dire projections of U.S. deaths from the coronavirus are placing new scrutiny on the Trump administration 's initial response while prompting questions about whether faster action could have lowered the death toll .\nThe White House presented sobering numbers on Tuesday that the best-case scenario with full mitigation measures in place is between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths in the United States . Those figures would exceed the U.S. death toll from the Vietnam War and Korean War combined .\nThe numbers have raised questions specifically about why the U.S. was slow to roll out tests to identify the virus , while bringing new criticism on President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi eyes end of April to bring a fourth coronavirus relief bill to the floor NBA to contribute 1 million surgical masks to NY essential workers Private equity firm with ties to Kushner asks Trump administration to relax rules on loan program : report MORE for downplaying the virus \u2019 s threat earlier this year .\nFurthermore , some say the U.S. is still not responding quickly enough . A number of states do not have stay-at-home orders , and Florida , where some officials see an emerging outbreak , only issued one on Wednesday .\nThe grim outlook has brought criticism to Trump and the federal government , along with state officials seen as not reacting quickly enough to the pandemic .\nLawrence Gostin , a public health expert at Georgetown University , said the death toll would be \u201c dramatically lower \u201d if the United States had taken earlier action .\n\u201c We wasted many weeks before we implemented social distancing and before we ramped up testing , \u201d he said . \u201c Even today the testing is spotty and social distancing is a patchwork across the country . \u201d\nAshish Jha , director of Harvard \u2019 s Global Health Institute , said on CNN Wednesday morning that earlier testing and earlier orders for people to stay at home would have made a difference .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know any public health expert who does not believe that if we had gotten our testing together , if we had gotten our hospitals ready , if we had communicated and gotten a lot of our lockdown orders going much earlier , we would n't have a very different situation , \u201d Jha said . \u201c We clearly would have . \u201d\nTop government experts have said that \u2019 s not completely clear to them .\nAsked by CNN \u2019 s Jim Acosta James ( Jim ) AcostaDire projections put new focus on Trump coronavirus response Judge rules lawsuit alleging Trump threatened free press can move forward Sean Spicer takes seat at White House press briefing MORE at a press briefing on Tuesday whether the death projections could have been lower with earlier action , Anthony Fauci Anthony FauciSunday shows preview : As coronavirus spreads in the U.S. , officials from each sector of public life weigh in Trump warns 'there will be a lot of death ' in the coming week How deadly is the coronavirus ? MORE , the government \u2019 s leading infectious disease expert , said it is possible , though it depends on how early the virus was circulating undetected .\n\u201c If there was no virus in the background , there was nothing to mitigate , \u201d Fauci said . \u201c If there was virus there that we did n't know about then the answer to your question is probably yes . \u201d\nHe added , though , that he did not want that to be a \u201c soundbite that gets taken out of context . \u201d\n\u201c In a perfect world , it would have been nice to know what was going on there , \u201d Fauci said of the early weeks of the outbreak . \u201c We did n't . But I believe , Jim , that we acted very , very early . \u201d\nTrump , at the same briefing , responded by again stressing his decision to close off travel from China at the end of January .\n\u201c I made a decision to stop China from coming in , took a lot of heat even from China , \u201d Trump said , adding : \u201c That was a big decision . \u201d\nChina has faced persistent doubts about its transparency and the statistics it is making public .\nAsked if the United States had gotten a \u201c late start \u201d on fighting the virus , Vice President Pence on Wednesday pointed to China , where the outbreak began .\n\u201c The reality is that we could \u2019 ve been better off if China had been more forthcoming , \u201d Pence told CNN .\nA sober Trump warned it was headed into two very tough weeks on Tuesday as officials unveiled models showing as many as 240,000 people could die even if social distancing was practiced .\nBut on Feb. 24 , he tweeted : \u201c The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA . We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries . CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart . Stock Market starting to look very good to me ! \u201d\nOn Feb. 27 , when the U.S. had 15 confirmed cases , he said : \u201c When you have 15 people , and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero , that \u2019 s a pretty good job we \u2019 ve done . \u201d\nOn March 9 , he compared the coronavirus to the flu and said despite thousands of deaths from the flu , \u201c Nothing is shut down , life & the economy go on . \u201d\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio Bill de BlasioUS attorney opposes release of inmates in DC Britain releases 4,000 inmates to curb spread of coronavirus NYC landlord tells tenants in 18 buildings to skip April rent MORE ( D ) has also faced criticism , including for going to work out at the gym hours before gyms were ordered to close because of the outbreak .\nThe New York Times reported that some top city health officials threatened to resign if he did not take stronger action to close schools and businesses .\nWhile New York is now the hardest hit area , the West Coast , which had the earliest known coronavirus cases , has fared better , at least so far . California was the first state to implement a stay-at-home order , on March 19 .\nWhite House officials on Tuesday showed a graph of California and Washington state with much flatter curves than New York and New Jersey .\nAbroad , experts point to the example of South Korea , which has been able to bend down its curve of cases far lower than the U.S. through extensive testing and tracing of infected people \u2019 s contacts to isolate them .\n\u201c It seems like the evidence is if we could have done that then things might be more under control , \u201d said Eleanor Murray , a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health .\nThe U.S. has now missed the initial window of opportunity to take that approach . But experts say in order to eventually ease up on blunt stay-at-home orders once the worst is passed , the U.S. needs to dramatically ramp up testing . That would allow for moving to a new phase of tracing infected people \u2019 s contacts and isolating them .\nWhile the projection of 100,000 to 240,000 deaths is sobering , it is also possible that the numbers could be even worse .\n\u201c Since we still don \u2019 t have great testing , our numbers are still potentially too low , \u201d Murray said .\nThose projections also assume full mitigation measures , but not every state has issued orders for their residents to stay at home .\nThe worst-case scenario in the White House model , with no intervention to slow the spread , is 1.5 million to 2.2 million deaths .\nTrump has declined to say whether all states should issue stay at home orders , and Gostin , the Georgetown professor , said he is concerned that some states still have not .\n\u201c Even now , \u201d he said , \u201c a month into the epidemic in the United States , we 're doing too little . \u201d",

        "content": "WASHINGTON ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 ) - U.S. intelligence indicates that the coronavirus likely occurred naturally , as opposed to being created in a laboratory in China , but there is no certainty either way , the top U.S. general said on Tuesday .\nThe remarks by Army General Mark Milley , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , could fan speculation about the coronavirus \u2019 origins \u2014 something China has dismissed as a conspiracy theory that is unhelpful to the fight against the pandemic .\nAsked whether he had any evidence that the virus began in a Chinese laboratory and was perhaps released accidentally , Milley was non-committal at a Pentagon news briefing .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of rumor and speculation in a wide variety of media , the blog sites , etc . It should be no surprise to you that we \u2019 ve taken a keen interest in that and we \u2019 ve had a lot of intelligence take a hard look at that , \u201d Milley said .\n\u201c And I would just say , at this point , it \u2019 s inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural . But we don \u2019 t know for certain . \u201d\nMilley \u2019 s comments could again stoke tension with Beijing , where Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian wrote on Twitter last month that the U.S. Army might have \u201c brought the epidemic to Wuhan . \u201d\nThe claim was denounced by the U.S. government and angered U.S. President Donald Trump , who cited it when he called the coronavirus \u201c the Chinese virus \u201d in briefings . The State Department said at the time that China was seeking to deflect criticism of its role in \u201c starting a global pandemic and not telling the world . \u201d\nAs far back as February , the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology pushed back against rumors that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its laboratories or perhaps got out from there .\nThe broad scientific consensus holds SARS-CoV-2 , the virus \u2019 official name , originated in bats .\nA Washington Post opinion column published on Tuesday said the U.S. State Department in 2018 warned in diplomatic cables about safety and management weaknesses at a WIV laboratory .\nThe Post noted that scientists largely agreed that the virus came from animals , as opposed to being synthesized . But it quoted one expert saying that did not rule out that it may have emerged from the WIV laboratory , which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals .\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to directly address the Washington Post column in interviews on Tuesday .\n\u201c We know this is a global pandemic that originated in Wuhan , China . We know that there were wet markets there . So we \u2019 re beginning to piece the facts together , \u201d Pompeo said in a radio interview .\nA team of 27 scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal in February condemning the conspiracy theories , which \u201c do nothing but create fear , rumors and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus . \u201d\nThey said scientists from around the world \u201c overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife . \u201d",

        "topic": "Coronavirus: Trump orders meatpacking plants to stay open",
        "date": "",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation 's food supply amid the coronavirus pandemic .\nHe invoked a Korean War-era law from the 1950s to mandate that the plants continue to function , amid industry warnings of strain on the supply chain .\nAn estimated 3,300 US meatpacking workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 20 have died .\nThe UN last month warned the emergency threatened global food supply chains .\nTwenty-two US meatpacking plants across the American Midwest have closed during the outbreak .\nThey include slaughterhouses owned by the nation 's biggest poultry , pork and beef producers , such as Smithfield Foods , Tyson Foods , Cargill and JBS USA .\n`` Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain , undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency , '' says Tuesday evening 's executive order , invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act .\n`` Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities , any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain . ''\nThe order designates the meatpacking plants as part of critical infrastructure in the US .\nA White House official told US media it will work with the Department of Labor to issue guidance for vulnerable workers , such as over-65s and those with chronic health conditions , to stay at home .\nThe leadership of large meatpacking companies have faced tough questions over whether they did enough to prepare for the pandemic and protect workers .\nOn top of the fact that production lines necessitate that workers stand very close together , most are low-income , hourly workers .\nMany are immigrants living paycheque to paycheque , like the ones at a Sioux Falls , South Dakota , pork plant who told the BBC that despite the risk , they have no choice but to go to work if plants are open .\nWithout strict adherence to safety guidelines - which are not currently being deemed `` mandatory '' by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - it 's not hard to picture new outbreaks at factories , or resurgences of the virus in factories that shuttered but reopen prematurely .\nAll of this could leave these employees trapped in the same impossible choice they were in when the virus first began spreading in factories in late March : risk my health or lose my job .\nJohn Tyson , chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page ads on Sunday in the Washington Post and New York Times to warn `` the nation 's food supply is breaking '' .\n`` As pork , beef and chicken plants are being forced to close , even for short periods of time , millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain , '' he wrote .\n`` As a result , there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed . ''\nHe said millions of cattle , pigs and chickens will be euthanised because of slaughterhouse closures , limiting supplies at supermarkets .\nPork production has borne the brunt , with daily output slashed by at least a quarter .\nTyson - which employs some 100,000 workers nationwide - has suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo , Iowa .\nSmithfield Foods shut down production at its plant in Sioux Falls , South Dakota , after an outbreak infected hundreds of employees .\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union ( UFCW ) , the largest US meatpacking union , demanded the Trump administration compel meat companies to provide proper protective equipment and ensure daily coronavirus testing for slaughterhouse workers .\n`` While we share the concern over the food supply , today 's executive order to force meatpacking plants to stay open must put the safety of our country 's meatpacking workers first , '' said the union .\nThe UFCW said the White House order would provide legal cover to companies in case employees catch coronavirus at work .\n`` We 're working with Tyson , '' Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier on Tuesday . `` We 're going to sign an executive order today , I believe , and that will solve any liability problems . ''\nRichard Trumka , the president of the AFL-CIO union , said : `` Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous . ''",

        "date": "",
        "content": "The federal government recommends no one attend gatherings of more than 10 people , but some churches are still encouraging big congregations to attend Easter Sunday services .\nCarlos Barria / Reuters Pastor Tony Spell attends Sunday service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , April 5 , challenging state orders against assembling in large groups to prevent the spread of COVID-19 .\nThe journalists at \u2588\u2588\u2588 are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus . To help keep this news free , become a member and sign up for our newsletter , Outbreak Today .\nWhen he picked up the phone and heard it was a reporter on the line , Louisiana Pastor Tony Spell almost immediately began reciting the Declaration of Independence . \u201c We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , \u201d Spell , the leader of Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Thursday morning over the phone . \u201c My government is not my creator , my president is not my God , \u201d continued Spell , who was charged with six misdemeanors last week for continuing to hold in-person services despite the coronavirus pandemic . \u201c The president did not give me my rights to worship God and to assemble in church , and no socialist government or godless president can take that right away . \u201d\n\u201c The president did not give me my rights to worship God . \u201d\nWhile the majority of churches in the country have chosen to suspend services during the coronavirus outbreak \u2014 choosing , when they can , to host their congregations online via livestream \u2014 several churches around the country have continued to hold services . Many of them have big Easter Sunday plans , even as some church gatherings across the US have led to outbreaks among their congregants . Glorious Way Church in Houston , Texas , plans to hold a socially distanced Easter morning service on Sunday , removing benches and using volunteer ushers to make sure family units stay six feet apart from one another , the distance recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services to help prevent spreading the virus . Solid Rock Church , a megachurch in Ohio , has stated it will keep holding services as long as the First Amendment of the Constitution is upheld , though a notice on its website says it is limiting its services , suspending collections and communion \u201c in a normal sense , \u201d and that there are not a \u201c large number of worshippers \u201d in the facility for services . A link to \u201c Easter @ Solid Rock \u201d leads to an unrelated event , and the church \u2019 s calendar seems to show that the church plans on holding two services Sunday at their Lebanon ( \u201c North \u201d ) campus , as well as some \u201c adult classes \u201d for members of the church , including a finance class and one called \u201c Marriage Matters. \u201d A woman who answered Solid Rock \u2019 s phone told \u2588\u2588\u2588 she has been advised to refer all callers to its website , due to \u201c all the bad press we \u2019 ve received \u201d for staying open . The website has a notice saying they \u201c agree we must all comply \u201d with Ohio \u2019 s order , and lists ways in which the church is attempting to mitigate the spread . However , it also insists it is the church \u2019 s responsibility to stay open , quoting this line from the New Testament : \u201c Let us not give up the habit of meeting together , as some are doing . Instead , let us encourage one another all the more , since you see that the Day of the Lord is coming nearer . Hebrews 10:25 . \u201d\nCome witness this POWERFUL moment in history ! We invite everyone out to come join us , as we observe Jesus ' last hours , through worship and skit . Tonight at 7pm here at The Bridge Church . This is a POWERFUL skit ! You do n't want to miss !\nThe Bridge Church in Robstown , Texas , has continued to hold special services leading up to Easter , Pastor Joel Garza told \u2588\u2588\u2588 over the phone Thursday , as well as its normal Sunday services . They disinfect the church before and after services , ask congregants to stay a \u201c safe distance \u201d from other families , and set up speakers in the parking lot for those who prefer to stay in their cars for service , but anywhere from 100 to 200 attendees have been showing up , Garza said , adding that he hopes more people come this Sunday for Easter services .\nSpell , of the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he is sending 27 buses out to bring congregants to his church for Easter Sunday service , and that he expects about 2,000 people to attend . The service will last all day with a rotating cast of congregants as more are bused in and out \u2014 about eight hours for the morning service and three hours in the evening , he said . Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak , medical experts have advised against gatherings of more than a few people . On March 15 , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) urged against the congregating of more than 50 people . Just a few days later , President Donald Trump released his guidelines for slowing the spread of coronavirus , including avoiding \u201c social gatherings in groups of 10 or more people. \u201d Many houses of worship are obeying these guidelines , and some influential religious organizations and sects , including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , the Catholic Church , the US Council of Muslim Organizations , and various denominations of Judaism have closed their houses of worship or are urging services take place online . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last month , a poll conducted in mid-March found that nearly a fifth of religious Americans said they were still attending in-person services . However , conditions have changed and worsened significantly since then , and some outbreaks have even occurred explicitly due to church gatherings . At least 70 attendees of a church in Sacramento , California , were diagnosed with COVID-19 last week , and in March churches in Arkansas and Illinois saw dozens of citizens fall ill after attending church events . Several states that have issued stay-at-home orders have included exceptions for houses of worship . New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , Michigan , and California have all issued stay-at-home orders that either designate houses of worship as \u201c essential \u201d ( exempting them from having to close ) or encourage them to close but exempt them from penalties . For example , Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer banned all gatherings outside the home , but added that \u201c a place of religious worship , when used for religious worship , is not subject to penalty '' for violating the order . Other states have directives that are not particularly clear on the guidelines for houses of worship . South Carolina and Alabama did not explicitly address houses of worship , but left them out of their list of nonessential businesses required to close . Louisiana Gov . John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in mid-March that banned gatherings of more than 50 people , but made exceptions for traveling \u201c to-and-from \u201d houses of worship . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine \u2019 s order exempts houses of worship from the state \u2019 s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people , but he then tweeted a plea to religious leaders to halt in-person services . Even with these exemptions , some religious leaders , like Spell , have flouted directives so openly that they are now facing criminal charges .\nGerald Herbert / AP Pastor Tony Spell speaks to media after holding an evening service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , March 31 .\nIn a phone call Thursday , Glorious Way Church Associate Pastor James Buntrock said that he has even hired law enforcement to be present at services to protect his congregation from media covering the church , or in case any \u201c activist type people \u201d try to show up to spread COVID-19 among the church attendees . \u201c Nobody has threatened us directly here , \u201d Buntrock said , adding that they haven \u2019 t had any problems with members of the press either : \u201c But I 've heard rumors of those possibilities , \u201d he said , \u201c so I just wanted to be prepared. \u201d Texas \u2019 stay-at-home order explicitly labeled houses of worship \u201c essential services , \u201d and some churches , like Glorious Way and the Bridge Church are taking that very seriously .\n\u201c We as essential organizations need to show up right now . \u201d\n\u201c We as essential organizations need to show up right now . If nurses and doctors , or police officers and firefighters , didn \u2019 t show up , it would be considered dishonorable , \u201d Bridge Church leader Joel Garza told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Yet churches , for whatever reason , seem to feel like it 's okay not to show up when our world needs us the most. \u201d Garza even went as far as to say that he believed attending services would help people fight off coronavirus . \u201c Right now people are staying at home , depressed , it weakens your immune system , and they 're most susceptible to disease through depression , \u201d Garza said . \u201c But if they come to church , they 're encouraged , they 're joyful , their immune system receives like a B-12 , and they 're able to go do better fighting off any kind of infirmities. \u201d American Psychological Association Director of Clinical Research and Quality Vaile Wright told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Friday that there was \u201c certainly no evidence \u201d to suggest that attending church could boost your immune system , and that even recommending a distance of 6 feet between congregants was still in violation of the CDC \u2019 s recommendations . \u201c Long-term stress can suppress the immune system and that can in turn lead to illness , and we do know social contact is a way to buffer stress . However , the benefit that can come from that social contact does not have to be face to face , \u201d Wright said . \u201c It \u2019 s important that we come together during these times of worship , but you have to balance that with the public health imperative to stay physically apart . \u201d\nGerald Herbert / AP Congregants arrive for evening service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana .\nStaff who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 from each of the churches choosing to remain open for Easter said they had received angry , and even vulgar and explicit , complaints about their choice , but that they see the pandemic as even more of a reason for them to stay open . The pastors also argued that they are providing concrete support for people affected by the pandemic through their charity . Many churches that have remained open have also been gathering and distributing food and essentials to people whose income or meal access has been affected by coronavirus closures . \u201c I appreciate what doctors and nurses are doing . We pray for them . They are right in the middle of this \u2014 they 're being separated from their families . It 's horrible , \u201d Glorious Way \u2019 s pastor Buntrock said . \u201c But the answer to this is not an entirely natural answer , \u201d he continued . \u201c We 've got to bring God into this . He is the answer to this . I want that message to get out . So that 's why we 're staying open. \u201d \u25cf",

But now , as states are allowing businesses to reopen around the country , he says lawmakers should look at who will most need relief in the coming months .\n\u201c We wanted to get money out quickly . We used the refund checks to do that , we used the PPP program to do that , \u201d he said , referring to the Small Business Administration \u2019 s popular Paycheck Protection Program .\n\u201c I think the next round we \u2019 ve got to be more targeted to those who are really in need . So I hope we can target this a little bit better to those who have been hit hard because of COVID-19 , \u201d he added .\nSen.

As a result , proposals for ideas other than stimulus checks are starting to gain momentum .\nWyden , a key player in upcoming talks for the next emergency spending bill , said he would back another round of direct payments but that they \u2019 re not his top priority .\n\u201c I would support additional payments , as well as fixing problems with the first round of payments like the exclusion of dependents and citizen children of immigrants . My top priorities are tying expanded unemployment benefits to economic conditions and providing more help for the smallest of small businesses , \u201d he said in a statement .\nWyden has proposed extending the weekly federal boost to state unemployment benefits , a key provision of the $ 2.2 trillion CARES Act enacted in late March . That provision is due to expire at the end of July .\nUnder Wyden \u2019 s plan , the federal boost to unemployment benefits would remain at $ 600 a week until a state \u2019 s three-month average total unemployment rate falls below 11 percent .\nWeekly federal unemployment compensation would drop by $ 100 a week for each percentage point decline in a state \u2019 s joblessness , bottoming out at 6 percent . That means workers would receive an extra $ 500 if their state \u2019 s unemployment rate is between 10 and 11 percent , down to an additional $ 100 where the jobless rate falls between 6 percent and 7 percent .\n\u201c I believe the economic conditions at the end of July workers are going to need another boost , \u201d he said , citing estimates earlier this month by White House officials that the U.S. unemployment rate is likely to hit 20 percent .\nWyden has also praised legislation sponsored by Sens .

There were no locally transmitted cases for the third consecutive day .\nBeijing and Shanghai were the main entry points for the returnees , many of whom are students studying abroad . They have come back after many campuses in the United States and Europe shut down to stem rapidly rising infection rates there .\nAlso returning in a flight to safety were China-based expats , as businesses begin to reopen .\nWhile there is no reported transmission of the virus from people arriving from abroad to local communities , authorities across China are tightening public health measures .\n\u201c Since March 11 , when the World Health Organization characterized the epidemic as a pandemic , the cumulative number of imported cases ( in China ) has risen from 85 to 269 , up by 216 % and outpacing the 98 % increase in the cumulative worldwide confirmed cases during the same period , \u201d Mi Feng , spokesman of the National Health Commission , said at a regular press briefing .\nChina must strictly prevent the import of the virus from overseas and a rebound in cases , Mi said .\nOf the 14 new imported cases in Beijing on Friday , five were Chinese students returning from abroad .

The death toll was 3,255 , up by seven , a much slower rate than at the height of the crisis .\nThe lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscored a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions , even in the virus epicenter of Wuhan .\nOn Saturday , the official Xinhua news agency said commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of virus can resume business , citing the municipal bureau of commerce .\nThe first phase of a clinical trial of a vaccine has kicked off , state-backed Science and Technology Daily reported on Saturday .\nThe first batch of 36 volunteers , comprising Wuhan residents aged between 18 and 60 , will undergo a 14-day quarantine at a centralized location .",

        "topic": "Fauci warns Congress that new US coronavirus cases could rise to 100,000 a day",
        "date": "2020-06-30",
        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci issued a stark warning on Tuesday to lawmakers on Capitol Hill , telling them he would n't be surprised if the US sees new cases of coronavirus rising to a level of 100,000 a day .\n`` We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day . I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around and so I am very concerned , '' Fauci told the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee during a hearing on the pandemic on Tuesday .\nFauci expressed dismay over people congregating in crowds and not wearing masks and inadequate attention being paid to guidelines on reopening .\n`` We 're going to continue to be in a lot of trouble , and there 's going to be a lot of hurt if that does not stop , '' he said .\nThe urgent message came during a hearing on the latest efforts by the US government to contain the pandemic , as several states struggle to contain the virus amid rising cases and state reopenings . The US reported more than 40,000 new Covid-19 cases on Friday , its biggest daily jump yet .\nAsked if the pandemic is under control , Fauci said , `` I am not satisfied with what 's going on because we are going in the wrong direction if you look at the curves of the new cases , so we 've really got to do something about that and we need to do it quickly , '' adding , `` Clearly we are not in total control right now . ''\nFauci said that he ca n't make an accurate prediction of the number of cases and deaths the US will see before the pandemic is over , but said , `` It 's going to be very disturbing , I will guarantee you that . ''\nFauci and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield stressed the importance of wearing masks during testimony before a Senate committee on Tuesday , with Fauci saying `` we recommend masks for everyone '' and `` masks are extremely important . ''\nRedfield singled out younger Americans in particular to deliver a message that they are not exempt from the necessity of wearing a mask .\n`` It is critical that we all take the personal responsibility to slow the transmission of Covid-19 and embrace the universal use of face coverings , '' he said . `` Specifically , I 'm addressing the younger members of our society , the Millennials and the Generation Zs -- I ask those that are listening to spread the word . ''\n`` We are all in this together , '' he said , adding , `` We recommend masks for everyone on the outside , anyone who comes into contact in a crowded area . You should avoid crowds where possible and when you 're outside and not have the capability of maintaining distance , you should wear a mask at all times . ''\nFauci indicated that he would support an effort to increase the production of high-quality masks in the US and distribute them free of charge to the American public in response to a question from Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders .\n`` Masks are extremely important , '' Fauci said , adding , `` There 's no doubt that wearing masks protects you and gets you to be protected . So it 's people protecting each other . Anything that furthers the use of masks , whether it 's giving out free masks or any other mechanism , I am thoroughly in favor of . ''\nMore than half of all states are seeing a rise in cases , and Florida , Texas and Arizona are getting hit particularly hard . Texas has begun scaling back its reopening , and beaches in Florida have closed for the upcoming holiday weekend .\nExperts testify on vaccine development as the FDA gets more involved\nDr. Stephen Hahn , commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said the FDA is taking action to help coronavirus vaccine developers get through the approval process faster .\n`` I am pleased to announce that today , FDA is taking action to aid the timely development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent Covid-19 by providing guidance for developers , with recommendations on the data needed to facilitate manufacturing , clinical development , and approval , '' he said .\nHahn said the FDA is committed to `` help expedite this work , '' but added , `` We will not cut corners in our decision making . ''\nHahn said the guidance will `` provide regulatory clarity around what FDA expects with respect to those data . We want to see certain parts of those data so that we can demonstrate to the world , to the nation , to the American people , that we are following our rigorous standards with respect to safety and efficacy . ''\n`` This is particularly as important as we know that some people are skeptical of vaccine development efforts , '' he continued , adding that `` public confidence in vaccines is so important . ''\nSeparately , Redfield said there was `` substantial disappointment with American Airlines '' when the airline announced it would stop limiting seat sales on airlines .\n`` I can tell you that when they announced that the other day , obviously there was substantial disappointment with American Airlines , '' Redfield said . `` I can say this is under critical review right now by us at CDC . We do n't think it 's the right message . ''\nLast week , American Airlines said it plans to begin selling every seat on flights , something it has not done since the pandemic struck this spring .\nThe airline responded to criticism of the decision , saying in a statement Tuesday that it is committed to the `` safety and well-being of ( its ) customers and team members . '' The airline said that it has `` multiple layers of protection '' for passengers and that it provides flexibility to those who want to change flights .\nFauci and Redfield testified before lawmakers last week , when Fauci said `` we 're going to be doing more testing , not less , '' in response to President Donald Trump 's recent claim that he asked his administration to slow down testing during the pandemic .\nSenators have been weighing another stimulus package in recent weeks as unemployment numbers remain worrisome and economic hardship stemming from the pandemic persists . Republicans remains divided on the size and scale of the next stimulus bill and while it has been discussed for months , the next phase of economic relief is still weeks away . But there is now broad agreement something has to be done -- something that was n't always the case .\nIn Capitol Hill 's last round of aid , Congress boosted unemployment checks by $ 600 a week and added 13 weeks of pay , beyond what states offer . The additional money will expire on July 31 without congressional action , but the 13-week extension will remain in place until the end of the year . A second round of stimulus payments is on the negotiating table in Washington , but some of the 160 million Americans who got money the first time could be left out , according a more targeted approach the administration is pushing for .\nRepublicans have zeroed in on the last week of July to reach agreement on the next round of stimulus legislation . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant for weeks on that timeline and the administration is on board .",

        "content": "Recent detailed data tell a more sobering story . New job postings on the employment platform ZipRecruiter fell in June after rising sharply in May . Data on small business openings and employment from Homebase , which provides scheduling and time tracking software for businesses , show that small business employment and openings worsened over the past week , after plateauing for much of June . The Homebase data showed a nearly 40 percent improvement for small business activity in May ; across all of June , that fell to 6 percent .\nStates suffering infection surges , like Texas , began to see layoffs and business closings even before officials moved to reimpose some restrictions on economic activity , such as closing bars .\nFoot traffic to retailers and other businesses declined in the third week of June in Houston , Orlando , Jacksonville , Phoenix and other large cities across the southern states where infections have spiked , according to an analysis of Safegraph.com data by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington . Data from 40 million households compiled by the financial firm Commerce Signals shows that after weeks of improvement , credit and debit card spending declined at the end of May across most states .\nThat is a pattern economists have been dreading , and a departure from the \u201c rocket ship \u201d recovery that President Trump promised in June . Federal Reserve officials have warned publicly that recovery appears perilous and highly dependent on public health . \u201c The path forward for the economy is extraordinarily uncertain and will depend in large part on our success in containing the virus , \u201d Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell told a House committee on Tuesday . \u201c A full recovery is unlikely until people are confident that it is safe to re-engage in a broad range of activities . \u201d\nThe next few months of recovery could be rocky even if the current infection surge abates . Job losses have slowed but remain at levels higher than in any previous recession , and a growing share of workers now report they have been laid off permanently , rather than temporarily furloughed . A significant share of small businesses have still not reopened , even as states increasingly lift restrictions on their operations , suggesting some of them may be shuttered for good . By many measures , business activity and employment remains down by a quarter or more from pre-crisis levels .",

A post-mortem examination has revealed that a person who died at home on 6 February in Santa Clara county is now the first known fatality in the US . Until now , the first fatality was thought to have been a man in Washington state who died on 26 February\nThe US Senate has unanimously approved $ 484bn ( \u00a3392bn ) in coronavirus relief , including funds designed to help small businesses . The legislation will go to the House of Representatives for approval on Thursday\nIn an interview with the Washington Post , Mr Redfield said that `` there 's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through '' .\nHe urged officials in the US to prepare for the possibility of having to confront a flu and a coronavirus epidemic at the same time .\nMr Redfield stressed the importance of getting flu shots . He said that getting vaccinated `` may allow there to be a hospital bed available for your mother or grandmother that may get coronavirus '' .\nThe CDC chief said that coronavirus had arrived in the US as the regular flu season was subsiding . He argued that if it had arrived at the peak of the winter influenza season , `` it could have been been really , really , really , really difficult '' .\nHis warning comes as several US states are moving to ease lockdown restrictions .\nMr Redfield said that social distancing remained key to curb the spread of the virus and urged officials to keep stressing its importance even as restrictions on movement were lifted .\nHe urged state and federal officials to step up tests to identify those who have coronavirus and the people they have had contact .\nHe said that the Centers for Disease Control planned to hire more than 650 people - more than doubling its current staff - to help with contact tracing among other things .\nThe CDC was also exploring the possibility of using Census Bureau workers to help with contact tracing he said .",

        "content": "Israel \u2019 s prime minister Saturday said he is ready to step down next year as part of a proposed power-sharing agreement with his chief rival meant to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis and end a year-long political deadlock .\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made his proposal during a nationally televised interview , calling for the formation of a three-year \u201c emergency \u201d unity government with the rival Blue and White Party .\nNetanyahu told Channel 12 TV that he would remain as prime minister for the first year and a half , and allow Blue and White leader Benny Gantz to assume the post for a second year-and-a-half term in September 2021 . He said each party would have an equal number of seats in the Cabinet .\n\u201c I will give up the prime minister \u2019 s post in another year and a half , \u201d Netanyahu said .\nYair Lapid , a senior Blue and White leader , dismissed Netanyahu 's unity offer as insincere . \u201c Next week , we will go to choose a new parliament speaker and work to battle coronavirus for the good of the people , \u201d he said .\nIsrael is facing a growing threat from the coronavirus pandemic . It has detected nearly 900 cases and on Friday reported its first death . With the public largely confined to their homes , the economy appears to be in great danger , with tens of thousands of people losing their jobs .\nBlue and White has accused Netanyahu of using the coronavirus crisis to undermine the country \u2019 s democratic institutions and try to derail his scheduled trial on corruption charges . Senior members of Gantz ' party have expressed skepticism at previous power-sharing overtures by Netanyahu , concerned that he would not follow through on his promises to cede power .\nIsrael this month held its third inconclusive election in under a year . Netanyahu \u2019 s Likud emerged as the largest single party , but fell short of securing a required parliamentary majority . A slim majority of lawmakers has endorsed Gantz as their choice for prime minister , though it is unclear whether he will be able to cobble together a governing coalition either .\nGantz now has just over three weeks to form a new government . In the meantime , he is trying to push through legislation in parliament that would in effect prevent Netanyahu from serving as prime minister in the future . The legislation would impose term limits on the prime minister and bar a politician indicted on criminal charges , like Netanyahu , from being prime minister .\nLast week , parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein , a member of Likud , suspended the parliament \u2019 s activities , preventing the newly elected legislature from choosing a new speaker and forming the committees needed to push through Blue and White \u2019 s legislative agenda .\nNetanyahu \u2019 s hand-picked justice minister last week also shut down most of the court system , delaying the prime minister \u2019 s trial until at least May .\nNetanyahu 's opponents have accused him and his surrogates of undermining the country 's democratic institutions . Blue and White planned to file a Supreme Court challenge on Sunday requiring parliament to resume its activities .\nWith the public ordered to stay at home , tens of thousands of people tuned in on social media late Saturday to a \u201c virtual protest , \u201d accusing Netanyahu of endangering the country \u2019 s democratic foundations . Former directors of the Mossad and Shin Bet security agencies were among the speakers .\n\u201c Benjamin Netanyahu , get yourself together and release us from being your hostages , \u201d said Yuval Diskin , a former Shin Bet director . \u201c Do it for the good of the country and the people . \u201d\nMore than 275,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus worldwide . The virus has killed more than 11,000 people , while more than 88,000 have recovered .\nMost people only experience minor flu-like symptoms from the coronavirus and recover within a few weeks , but the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear well . It can cause severe illness , including pneumonia , in some patients , particularly the elderly and those with underlying health problems .",

        "content": "The question , then , isn \u2019 t whether the coronavirus is \u201c airborne \u201d in the tediously academic way the word has been defined . As the journalist Roxanne Khamsi puts it , the virus is \u201c definitely borne by air. \u201d The better questions are : How far does the virus move ? And is it stable and concentrated enough at the end of its journey to harm someone \u2019 s health ?\nA handful of studies have offered preliminary answers . One team of researchers blasted virus-laden fluids into a rotating cylinder to create a cloud of aerosols . They found that the virus remained stable for several hours within that cloud , raising fears about its ability to persist in ambient air . But as the researchers have noted , the study \u2019 s experimental setup was artificial . It doesn \u2019 t reflect \u201c what \u2019 s occurring when you \u2019 re just walking down the street , \u201d says Saskia Popescu of George Mason University , who specializes in infection control and who was not involved in the study . \u201c It \u2019 s more akin to medically invasive procedures like intubation , which run the risk of aerosolizing the virus , and are unique to the health-care setting . \u201d\nA second study suggests that the coronavirus can be released into the air in less dramatic ways . Joshua Santarpia and his colleagues at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found traces of the coronavirus \u2019 s RNA\u2014its genetic material\u2014in rooms occupied by a total of 13 COVID-19 patients , most of whom had only mild symptoms . The RNA was on obvious places such as bed rails and toilets , but also on harder-to-reach spots such as ventilation grates , window ledges , and the floors beneath the beds . The RNA even lingered in the air ; using air-samplers , the team detected viral RNA floating more than six feet away from the patients , and even in the hallways just outside the patients \u2019 rooms .\nThis isn \u2019 t necessarily cause for alarm . Finding viral RNA is like finding a fingerprint at a crime scene\u2014the culprit was once there , but might be long gone . So far , the Nebraska team has failed to detect live , infectious virus in its air samples . Santarpia told me that further tests are under way , and results will be released soon .\nIf the Nebraska team does find infectious particles , it would mean that even mildly symptomatic people can expel SARS-CoV-2 into the air , and that the virus can travel at least the length of a hospital room\u2014a claim supported by a few other studies . Even that , though , would not guarantee danger . Are those far-spreading virus particles concentrated enough to infect another person in the same room ? How many virus particles does it even take to launch an infection ? How far does the virus travel in outdoor spaces , or in other indoor settings ? Have these airborne movements affected the course of the pandemic ?\nThese questions have no answers yet . To get those answers , \u201c you \u2019 d have to expose animals to different quantities of airborne viruses , see if they get infected , and relate that to measures of the virus [ in places ] where people are infected , \u201d says Bill Hanage , an epidemiologist at Harvard . \u201c This is the type of stuff people will work on for years , but no one is going to find out for the moment . \u201d",

        "date": "2020-04-26",
        "content": "The state has been in retreat since the 80s heyday of Reagan and Thatcher but that could change as coronavirus delivers a shock to the system of historic proportions\nThe state we 're in : will the pandemic revolutionise the role of government ?\nThe state we 're in : will the pandemic revolutionise the role of government ?\nRonald Reagan \u2019 s 1986 wisecrack \u2013 \u201c The nine most terrifying words in the English language are : I \u2019 m from the government and I \u2019 m here to help \u201d \u2013 would not get a lot of laughs today . In much of the world , people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic .\nReagan \u2019 s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades , spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries .\nThe antipathy to the state was selective : Reagan , like Donald Trump today , racked up huge deficits , spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks . But on both sides of the Atlantic , the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate .\nThere are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes . Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception .\nSome social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective . And now we \u2019 re actually back into the kind of spirit that our parents and grandparents lived through in which communities have to pull together , \u201d Fiona Hill , a British-born historian who served on Trump \u2019 s national security council .\nHill pointed to the UK , where 750,000 people signed up as volunteers for the National Health Service ( NHS ) and a wave of climate activism on both sides of the Atlantic .\n\u201c I do think there is a huge appetite among younger people , trying to get more government action . I really do think we could start to see the tide turning here . \u201d\nSome of the biggest swings in public opinion have been in countries where the state \u2019 s role in social welfare has been in most rapid retreat .\nThe US and the UK stand out because the pandemic struck as their governments were seeking to roll back longstanding social welfare systems and are now scrambling to reassemble temporary versions of them on the run .\nWhat is not clear yet is whether these stopgap measures will evaporate as soon as Covid-19 is sufficiently contained for people to go back to work \u2013 or whether some of them will stick .\nAuthoritarian leaders may use Covid-19 crisis to tighten their grip Read more\nThe coronavirus pandemic could also boost statism of another kind \u2013 more Big Brother than Great Society \u2013 by providing cover for governments to restrict civil liberties and entrench themselves in power , as Viktor Orb\u00e1n has done in Hungary . There are few signs yet that China \u2019 s leaders will be held accountable for their failure to contain the outbreak at its source , and their response to criticism has been further suppression of dissent and science .\nThe outbreak has created a surge in digital monitoring of populations that many civil libertarians fear will harden afterwards into a permanently raised level of surveillance .\nThe accretion of state power could accompany wider provision of public services , or take precedence over them . The less a government does for its people , the more it has to control them .\nIn the US , the Trump administration is likely to face resistance if it seeks to withdraw forms of social support that have long been standard in most western democracies .\n\u201c The whole pandemic , I think , has laid bare all of the inadequacies of the US social safety net , \u201d John Schmitt , the vice-president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington , said . \u201c A very basic thing every other advanced economy in the world guarantees workers is at least a minimum amount of paid sick days . The US does not have at the national level any laws like that .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard for me to imagine that there won \u2019 t be significant support when the dust settles for state , local and federal legislation to address that incredibly longstanding policy failure , \u201d he said .\nThere are two other areas where Schmitt predicted there would be strong demand for lasting change . One is unemployment insurance , currently a meagre patchwork of different state systems subject to minimum national standards .\nProfit over people , cost over care : America 's broken healthcare exposed by virus Read more\nThe other is the healthcare system . As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance , it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration \u2019 s Affordable Care Act , which extended the scope of health insurance coverage , and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare .\nFor parallel reasons , it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington , after it saved his life .\nIt is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year \u2019 s US elections . All other things being equal , greater popularity for a government-funded social safety net should translate into more votes for Democrats , who have traditionally championed such policies . But Trump will seek to take that ground , insisting , for example , that his name is on the $ 600 cheques the federal government is sending out each week to supplement unemployment benefit .\nAnd the elections could be as much about cultural and political loyalties as social policy .\nArlie Hochschild , a sociologist who has written extensively about the American right , said she had been watching responses to the crisis in Kentucky .\n\u201c Trump supporters are generally older people in poor health , and if they \u2019 re blue-collar , they \u2019 re actually less likely to have work that they can do from home , \u201d Hochschild said . \u201c What \u2019 s happened in this short period of time has challenged so much of what they believe in . \u201d\nDespite that , she said , the crisis seemed to have had little effect on political identification and affiliation . \u201c There is no immediate turnaround in attitude . I think they \u2019 re going to vote for Trump , pretty much at the same rate as they did in \u2019 16 . \u201d\nTwo states : one Democrat , one Republican . Two very different outcomes Read more\nIf Trump is re-elected , few believe there will be much lasting change to the role of the state . His instincts have been to seek to hand leadership during the crisis to the CEOs of big corporations , lining them up in the Rose Garden when he declared a national emergency on 13 March .\nOpinions differ on whether a Democratic administration under Joe Biden would be a force for transformational change .\n\u2018 You \u2019 re seeing a closer alliance between the left and the centre of the Democratic party \u201d Theda Skocpol , a sociology professor at Harvard University , said . If Democrats also capture the Senate , she added : \u201c I think it sets the stage for for a real change in direction \u2013 the first important one since Reagan . \u201d\nDean Baker , co-founder of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington \u2013 and one of the first economists to identify the US housing bubble that created the conditions for the global financial meltdown in 2008 \u2013 argues that that crisis demonstrated how impervious the economic system was to shocks , no matter who is in government .\n\u201c The thought that we had this horrible experience and now everyone \u2019 s going to learn from it : it wasn \u2019 t true really in \u2019 08- \u2019 09 , and I don \u2019 t have a lot of confidence it \u2019 ll be true this time , \u201d Baker said .\nMuch may depend on the depth and duration of the coronavirus shock . A V-shaped , rapid bounceback is looking less likely with every passing week , and a gradual U-shaped recovery or even an extended depression become real possibilities . In such circumstances , formerly unthinkable solutions become more palatable .\n\u201c People use the analogy of the financial crisis but I think it \u2019 s the wrong one . War is a much better one because it is both a supply and a demand shock , \u201d said Branko Milanovic , an economist at the City University of New York , adding that a prolonged economic downturn would lead to \u201c a reassessment of the role of the state \u201d .\nMilanovic cautioned , however , that it was also quite possible that a groundswell of support for a universal healthcare system and a much more robust social safety net might not be reflected in the US political system . He said : \u201c What we would actually face in the US is an ever-increasing discrepancy between the demand for change , and the total absence of change . \u201d",

        "content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday refuted the \u201c partisan wish list \u201d label lobbed at her $ 3 trillion coronavirus relief bill , saying it \u2019 s no different than other packages Congress has passed .\nAt a press conference , Mrs. Pelosi , California Democrat , argued that there was a double standard for Democrats , pointing out that the initial versions of the $ 2.2 trillion CARES Act and the emergency interim bill for small business loans were put out by the GOP .\nDemocrats objected to both of those early proposals and bipartisan packages were negotiated .\n\u201c It \u2019 s no leader when the leader in the House , a Democrat , writes a bill , \u201d she said . \u201c So now we \u2019 re putting our offer on the table . We \u2019 re open to negotiations . \u201d\n\u201c Wait a minute , it wasn \u2019 t partisan when they did it ? \u201d she added .\nThe massive Democrat-led package has received a wave of backlash from Republicans , and even a few moderate Democrats , for being an unserious attempt and more of a messaging bill .\n\u201c This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship , this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most , \u201d Rep. Kendra Horn , Oklahoma Democrat , tweeted . \u201c We must work with our Republican colleagues and leadership in the Senate to negotiate a targeted relief bill that is aimed squarely at the health and economic challenges we face . \u201d\n\u201c I urge House leadership to put aside any desire to use this as a political opportunity and instead focus on getting results in a bipartisan , bicameral way . The American people need our help , \u201d she added .\nMrs. Pelosi argued that much of what is in the bill \u2014 \u201c well over 80 % \u201d \u2014 is something Congress has voted on before , such as state and local government , testing funding , and funding for government programs such as SNAP .\nThe bill provides over $ 800 billion for state and local governments \u2014 a major priority for Democrats left out of the last bill , but an area of suspicion for Republicans .\nAdditionally , the bill expands access to voting by mail , by saying states can \u2019 t impose additional requirements on otherwise eligible voters to cast an absentee ballot through the mail .\nIt also includes $ 175 billion for rent and mortgage subsidies and $ 25 billion in assistance for the struggling U.S. Post Office .\nThe bill eliminates for two years a $ 10,000 cap on the state and local tax deduction , a prized benefit for generally higher-income residents in blue , high-tax states .\nThe House is set to vote on the bill , dubbed the Heroes Act , as well as a historic temporary rules change to allow the chamber to vote by proxy and hold remote committee hearings .\nMrs. Pelosi slammed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for resisting another package .\n\u201c He wants us to just pause . But families know that hunger doesn \u2019 t take a pause , \u201d she said . \u201c The hardship of it all \u2026 it just doesn \u2019 t take a pause . \u201d\nMrs. Pelosi said that she expects Republicans will eventually come up with their own offer .\nMr. McConnell , however , said his focus is on working on a package to implement liability protections for small business owners and health care providers .",

''\n`` With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic , we have deep concerns whether America \u2019 s generosity has been put to the the best use possible , '' Trump said at a briefing in the Rose Garden .\n`` If we can not trust them , if this is what we will receive from the WHO , our country will be forced to find other ways to work with other nations to achieve public health goals . ''\nBy the numbers : The WHO 's 2018-2019 budget was about $ 6 billion , and the U.S. is by far the biggest donor of any country , contributing more than $ 400 million to the organization last year .\n`` American taxpayers provided between $ 400 million and $ 500 million per year to the WHO . In contrast , China contributes roughly $ 40 million a year , or even less , '' Trump said Tuesday .\n`` As the organization \u2019 s leading sponsor , the United States has a duty to insist on full accountability . One of the most dangerous and costly decisions from the WHO was its disastrous decision to oppose travel restrictions from China and other nations . \u201d\nBehind the scenes : Trump has been fuming for days about what he sees as the WHO 's botched response to the pandemic and its deference to China .\n`` The WHO really blew it . For some reason , funded largely by the United States , yet very China centric . We will be giving that a good look , '' Trump tweeted last week .\nTrump 's national security team has rallied behind him , believing that the U.S. needed to go beyond public statements and make the WHO feel some pain for its missteps , according to officials involved in the internal discussions .\nThe decision gives Trump somebody else to blame , and a way to deflect from his own missteps in handling the virus .\nDetails : Below are some of Trump 's specific complaints , which he said led him to his decision to freeze U.S. funding :\n`` The WHO failed to adequately obtain , vet , and share information in a timely and transparent fashion . ... The WHO failed in this basic duty and must be held accountable . ''\n`` The WHO failed to investigate credible reports from sources in Wuhan that conflicted directly with the Chinese government \u2019 s official accounts . There was credible information to suspect human-to-human transmission in December 2019 , which should have spurred the WHO to investigate . ''\n`` Through the middle of January , it parroted and publicly endorsed the idea that there was not human to human transmission happening , despite reports and clear evidence to the contrary. ``\n`` The delays the WHO experienced in declaring a public health emergency cost valuable time , tremendous amounts of time . ''\n`` The inability of the WHO to obtain virus samples to this day has deprived the scientific community of essential data . ''\n`` The WHO has not addressed a single one of these concerns nor provided a serious explanation that acknowledges its own mistakes , of which there were many . ''\nBackground : Over the past week , officials within the White House 's Office of Management and Budget have been working on a menu of options for how to snub the WHO . Trump administration officials told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the options fall along two tracks .\nThe most likely route is to reprogram U.S. funding that was allocated to the WHO , moving it to other international organizations that can administer it for comparable purposes , officials said .\nA more dramatic , but less likely , approach is to send a rescissions package to Congress , rescinding from the federal budget funds already allocated to WHO . A similar approach was adopted in 2017 when the U.S. cut $ 285 million from its funding to the United Nations .\nTrump did not reveal on Tuesday which mechanism he will use to halt funding to the organization .\nWhat they 're saying : Antonio Guterres , secretary-general of the UN , to which the WHO reports , said in a statement , `` '' Now is a time for unity in the global battle to push the COVID-19 pandemic into reverse , not a time to cut the resources of the ... WHO , which is spearheading and coordinating the global body \u2019 s efforts . ''\nGo deeper : Aides prepare options for Trump to shun WHO over coronavirus",

        "date": "2020-05-11",
        "content": "Trump Says More Testing Makes U.S. 'Look Bad , ' But Its Availability Remains A Concern\nThe coronavirus has in recent days edged closer to President Trump . At least two White House aides who 've been in proximity to the president and the vice president have tested positive for COVID-19 .\nBecause of that , three key members of the Trump administration 's pandemic response team are quarantining themselves : Drs . Robert Redfield , Stephen Hahn and Anthony Fauci . Redfield is head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Hahn heads up the Food and Drug Administration and Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the nation 's top infectious disease expert .\nAll three , plus the assistant secretary for health , Dr. Brett Giroir , are slated to testify before a key Senate committee Tuesday . The hearing , which is ironically titled `` COVID-19 : Safely Getting Back to Work and Back to School , '' will now be done via video conference .\nThe chair of that committee , Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander , is also self-quarantining . His office announced Sunday night that a member of the staff tested positive for COVID-19 . Alexander will chair Tuesday 's hearing from Tennessee .\nIn recent days , Alexander has said that the coronavirus testing the United States has done so far is `` not nearly enough , '' and `` there is no safe path forward to combat the novel coronavirus without adequate testing . ''\nTrump has touted the overall number of tests that have been conducted in the country \u2014 now more than 8 million . But at times he 's read a different message in them .\n`` If we did very little testing , [ America ] would n't have the most cases , '' Trump said Wednesday . `` So , in a way , by doing all of this testing , we make ourselves look bad . ''\nAnd Trump 's reservations about testing appear to be rooted in politics . Trump said Friday he believes some Democrats hope the economy does n't bounce back .\n`` I will tell you , you look at some cases , some people think they 're doing it for politics , '' Trump said on Fox News Channel . `` Here we go again . But they think they 're doing it because it 'll hurt me , the longer it takes to \u2014 hurt me in the election , the longer it takes to open up . ''\nBut Trump 's focus on how the pandemic makes him and the nation look does n't get the country closer to being prepared and able to live with the coronavirus .\n`` We have to figure out how to live with this virus , and that 's what we 're not doing , '' Michael Osterholm , director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota , said on NBC 's Meet the Press Sunday .\nOn the White House schedule Monday : a press briefing about testing .\n1 . Climbing coronavirus death toll : The confirmed number of Americans who have now died from the coronavirus is about 80,000 . At a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 deaths per day , the U.S. would surpass 100,000 deaths from COVID-19 between May 21 and May 31 . The country 's curve has plateaued , but it appears to have a long tail . And that flattening is masked by New York and New Jersey 's daily new cases coming down , because new cases are on the rise in other places .\n2 . Those CDC guidelines for reopening : If you 're wondering why \u2014 despite access to some of the top scientists in the world \u2014 there have n't been clearer and more detailed reopening guidelines for states , businesses and religious institutions coming from the federal government , you 're not alone . And now we know why : The White House buried them . The guidelines from the CDC were shelved , the AP reported .\nFollowing the publication of the report , CDC Director Redfield issued a statement that appeared to run contrary to his published internal emails . He took responsibility and said the document was `` shared prematurely , '' `` was in draft form and had not been vetted through the interagency review process . '' Because of that , Redfield added , he `` was not yet comfortable releasing a final work product . ''\nWill the CDC release new guidelines at some point now that this is out there ?\n3 . Will the White House push for another relief package \u2014 or not ? White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said on CNN 's State of the Union Sunday that another relief package would be `` premature '' given the others that have already passed and trillions total in aid . `` We think that we have a little moment , the luxury of a moment , to learn about what 's going on so that the next step that we take can be prudent . '' Luxury of a moment ? The country on Friday hit its highest unemployment rate , 14.7 % , since the Great Depression , most economists think that number is actually higher , and Americans lost a whopping 20 million jobs \u2014 in one month .\n4 . U.S. Supreme Court on religious freedom , Trump 's financial records and faithless electors : People may be home , but the Supreme Court justices are working \u2014 even if remotely . On Monday , the court considers arguments about whether lay teachers at parochial schools are protected from discrimination or whether the schools can have carte blanche in hiring and firing .\nOn Tuesday , it 's Trump 's financial records and whether Congress has the power to subpoena records from when before Trump was president \u2014 and whether those can be used in a potential criminal investigation .\nLaw Toilet Flush Heard During Supreme Court 's Conference Call Toilet Flush Heard During Supreme Court 's Conference Call Listen \u00b7 0:25 0:25\nOn Wednesday , the quirky Electoral College system sees a challenge . Electors are actually people , and sometimes they do n't go the way their state voted . The court considers whether that 's OK .\nFor everyone 's sake , let 's hope those mute buttons are working better this week , especially close to any toilets .\n5 . Will Bright be reinstated ? Rick Bright , the former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority , a key agency in vaccine development , will testify before a House committee Thursday . It comes after he filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration for being dismissed from his position , he says , for sounding alarms about the coronavirus early on and expressing opposition to unproven treatments favored by Trump . Bright 's lawyers say the Office of Special Counsel has made a determination that he was dismissed for retaliation and should be temporarily reinstated while the office investigates . Trump has ignored the same office 's recommendations before , but Bright 's case will continue to be in the public eye , especially this week \u2014 and as the pandemic fallout continues .\n`` It would have been bad even with the best of governments . It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset \u2014 of 'what 's in it for me ' and 'to heck with everybody else ' \u2014 when that mindset is operationalized in our government . ''\n\u2014 Former President Barack Obama on the Trump administration 's coronavirus response . The comments were revealed in a leaked recording of Obama speaking to a group of members of his administration .",

        "date": "2020-03-12",
        "content": "Joe Biden used his much hyped public address on the coronavirus pandemic to take political shots at President Donald Trump .\nThe former vice president , who looks to be a shoe-in for the Democrat nomination , unveiled his proposal for containing the virus on Thursday in a speech that was billed by supporters as commander-in-chief-worthy . Neither Biden nor the speech , in fact , lived up to that hype . Instead of urging unity and calm in the face of the growing pandemic , Biden took the opportunity to lambast Trump for ignoring science , having an \u201c adversarial relationship with the truth , \u201d and promoting racism .\n\u201c Unfortunately , this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration , \u201d the former vice president said on Thursday . \u201c Public fears are being compounded by [ a ] pervasive lack of trust in this president , fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth . \u201d\nIn order to combat the virus , Biden argued it was paramount to have leadership that was open-minded and willing to cooperate across national boundaries . He said :\nOur government \u2019 s ability to respond effectively has been undermined by hollowing out our agencies and the disparagement of science . Our ability to derive a global response is dramatically undercut by the damage Trump has done to our credibility and our relationships around the world .\nEven though many of the solutions Biden proposed are already being implemented by the federal government , the former vice president went on to accuse Trump of sowing fear and racial division . Biden , in particular , claimed that Trump \u2019 s attempt to hold China accountable for failing to contain the virus were emboldening racism and \u201c xenophobia . \u201d\n\u201c Labeling COVID-19 a \u2018 foreign virus \u2019 does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration , \u201d the former vice president said . \u201c Let me be crystal clear : the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation . \u201d\n\u201c Acts of racism and xenophobia against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community must not be tolerated , \u201d Biden added .\nThe speech comes one day after the Biden campaign unveiled its \u201c Public Health Advisory Committee , \u201d which is tasked with providing the former vice president guidance on the pandemic . The political leanings of some of individuals tapped for the committee were made evident by a plan Biden touted on Thursday , which included among its proposals for combatting the virus the rejoining of the Paris climate accord .",

        "date": "",
        "content": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox . Sign up here .\nA class-action lawsuit filed in Florida this month seeks to `` make China pay for what they 've done '' in its handling of the coronavirus crisis , saying the country acted `` negligently in their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak . ''\nA personal injury law firm based in Boca Raton , Fla. , is bringing the suit against China and various Chinese government agencies on behalf of `` individuals and business owners in the United States and State of Florida , for damages suffered as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic . ''\nThe suit claims China `` knew that COVID-19 was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic , yet slowly acted , proverbially put their head in the sand , and/or covered it up in their own economic self-interest . ''\n`` This is an undertaking against a world superpower who has the ability to pay for what they 've done , '' Jeremy Alters , the chief strategist and non-attorney spokesperson for the Berman Law Group , the class-action firm backing the suit , told Fox News .\n`` They have the money to pay for what they 've done , and we should all together make China pay for what they 've done , '' he said .\nWHITE HOUSE , SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $ 2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL , BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN\nThe original complaint has just a handful of named plaintiffs but the lawyers familiar with the case at Berman Law Group say they plan to file an amended complaint at some point with significantly more plaintiffs , including individuals who have gotten sick because of the coronavirus .\nThe lawsuit does not name a specific dollar amount being sought from China , asking for `` compensatory and other damages to Plaintiffs and the Class Members , for their economic and non-economic damages ... to the full extent permitted by the law . '' Alters , however , made clear that though lawyers for Berman would be seeking potentially `` tens of trillions '' from the communist nation , the suit was largely about the symbolism of forcing China to defend its actions in American courts .\n`` We want the court to make them pay for what they 've done , '' Alters said . `` They have unleashed ... a massive pandemic on the world . It appears they knew about it long before they gave information about it to the rest of the world . We want our courts to say , 'China , you are going to be held accountable here in our courts because you have harmed hundreds of millions of Americans . ' ''\nThe suit also has the potential , according to its backers , to bring to light documents and other information about the coronavirus that China may still be withholding from other governments and health experts worldwide .\nThis class-action suit is not the only one filed against China over the coronavirus , but it is the main serious complaint . The D.C.-based far-right organization Freedom Watch filed a $ 20 trillion suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas accusing the Chinese of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon \u2014 an allegation that has been debunked .\nThe Florida-based suit , however , seeks damages based on the Chinese government 's negligence in containing the coronavirus after it first was transmitted from animals to humans , an allegation with a large amount of supporting evidence .\nTHE CORONAVIRUS DID NOT ESCAPE FROM A LAB : HERE 'S HOW WE KNOW\nThis is made difficult , however , by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act ( FSIA ) which prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances . The plaintiffs claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and `` personal injury or death '' that stems from `` the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment . ''\nYale law professor Stephen L. Carter , however , argued in a Bloomberg column Tuesday that the Florida suit 's claims do n't fall under the FSIA exceptions .\n`` The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies , but it \u2019 s not easy to see how , '' Carter writes .\nCarter also notes that the second exemption the Florida plaintiffs claim `` specifically bars any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused . ' It \u2019 s hard to find a way around this restriction . ''\nBut Alters says China 's negligence in its response to the coronavirus should fall under the exceptions to FSIA because of how egregious it is .\n`` There is a lengthy history of precedent for bringing foreign nations to our courts for their bad acts that affect Americans , '' he said Tuesday . `` I do n't know in history whether there has been another bad act like this that has affected this many Americans at once , where the entire economy is basically at a standstill and 14 states are now in a stay-at-home order . ''\nThe Florida suit against China also is important , according to its backers , because of the collaboration between two very different firms working the case .\nCORONAVIRUS HITTING NEW YORK LIKE A 'BULLET TRAIN ' AS CASES ARE 'DOUBLING ABOUT EVERY 3 DAYS ' , CUOMO WARNS\nBerman Law Group counts presidential candidate Joe Biden 's brother , Francis , as a senior adviser . Alters , a spokesman for Berman , is a veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign .\nThe lobbying and public relations firm working on the case , Lucas Compton , is closer to the right side of the aisle . George Sorial is a partner at Lucas Compton and worked in the Trump Organization for several years before leaving the company to become a campaign surrogate for the now-president .\n`` It transcends politics , '' Sorial said of the effort to sue China . `` Even if you look at the collaboration of our two firms , two firms on very different sides of the aisle . ... They are who they are , we are who we are , but this transcends politics . ... This is a nonpolitical bipartisan effort on behalf of the United States citizenry . It 's almost a patriotic thing to hold that country accountable . ''\nBeyond the FSIA difficulties , another likely weakness in the case is the fact that it treats the idea that the coronavirus potentially came from a lab -- which has been debunked -- as a legitimate `` alternative theory . '' This could potentially undermine the majority of its case , which pushes the widely understood story that the virus was transmitted from an animal to a human at a wild animal market in the city of Wuhan before China responded to the health threat with obfuscation and censorship .\nResponding to a question about the inclusion of the manmade virus theory in their lawsuit , Alters said the presence of a high-security bio-agent lab in Wuhan `` can not be ignored . ''\n`` [ The Wuhan Institute of Virology ] handles the most dangerous viruses , '' he said . `` It resides in the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan . In that lab they cultivate viruses from exotic animals . The wet markets were supposed to be shut down years ago and the Chinese government turned a blind eye to the ongoing operations . This is not coincidental . They also knew of the active and routine trade of these exotic animals which harbor these viruses . The Chinese government has allowed the sale , exchange and consumption of these animals by putting their head in the sand knowing of the dangers this presented locally and internationally . ''\nThe initial conference in the case is set for May 1 before Judge Ursula Ungaro .",

        "date": "2020-05-01",
        "content": "In 2010 , the moral philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah made a list of practices that he believed people in the distant future will condemn our generation of humanity for , much as people in the 21st century almost universally condemn slavery or the denial of women \u2019 s suffrage .\nHis four candidates were the American prison system , which cages about 2.3 million Americans at any given time ; the exploitation of animals in factory farms ; the abandonment of America \u2019 s elderly ( and the elderly of many rich countries ) in nursing homes ; and environmental degradation .\nMy friend Avi Zenilman , a journalist turned nurse , sent me Appiah \u2019 s piece a few weeks into the coronavirus pandemic , when Appiah \u2019 s list started to read like a premonition . Excluding the environment \u2014 climate change specifically , which has gotten a temporary respite as we do much less carbon emitting under quarantine \u2014 Appiah \u2019 s list doubles as a rundown of the most prominent and brutal vectors of Covid-19 in the US .\nCoronavirus outbreaks have been reported at carceral facilities across the country , including pretrial detention centers like Rikers Island where most inmates have not yet been convicted of the offense with which they \u2019 re charged ; one prison in Ohio reported that 78 percent of inmates tested positive . More humane states are releasing prisoners simply to avoid a medical catastrophe that feels inevitable if they stay caged .\nThe Tyson , Smithfield , and JBS meat production companies have shut down pork plants that collectively produce 15 percent of America \u2019 s pork due to coronavirus spread . Tyson \u2019 s CEO took out a full-page newspaper ad warning that the nation \u2019 s food supply is breaking down . That \u2019 s a ludicrous exaggeration ( experts say the US isn \u2019 t about to run out of food ) , but it is true that the factory farming industry is particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 and poses a pandemic risk generally .\nNursing homes for both older people and those with disabilities are likewise seeing widespread coronavirus outbreaks . The Washington Post analyzed news reports and state data releases and found almost 1 in 10 nursing homes in the US have reported coronavirus cases . The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that in the 23 states for which data exists , 27 percent of deaths from Covid-19 have occurred in nursing homes . In several states , like Massachusetts and Pennsylvania , most deaths have occurred in nursing homes .\nIt \u2019 s not a coincidence that Covid-19 is foregrounding these institutions . This crisis has cast a spotlight on inequalities that have plagued American life for decades , and it is forcing us to look seriously at how we relate to one another . Social distancing has a way of clarifying social reality , and America \u2019 s social reality is one of haves and have-nots .\nWhat nursing homes , prisons , and factory farms have in common\nIf I were more religious , I would say this feels like a biblical plague , a force beyond our control identifying our worst societal sins to get us to finally pay attention . But that would be incorrect , because in many ways the spread of this virus is within our control . That the coronavirus has ripped through the US via these vectors only underscores how complicit Americans have been in making ourselves more vulnerable to this disease .\nWhat factory farms , prisons , and nursing homes have in common is that they \u2019 re warehousing efforts . They all involve placing people or animals into confined facilities where most of society doesn \u2019 t have to think too hard about them anymore . They are institutions optimized for neglect .\nFew people would likely be able to eat a Chicken McNugget if each order came with a photo of the tortured chickens who were killed to fulfill that order ; but because that torture takes place behind closed doors , confined to a few big facilities in rural areas and staffed by invisible low-wage workers , people are free to forget about the actual chickens and the working conditions there and eat their nuggets in peace . It \u2019 s no fluke that \u201c ag gag \u201d laws banning the dissemination of information about factory farms are one of the industry \u2019 s main lobbying priorities . Big corporations know perfectly well what would happen if people actually paid attention .\nPrisons enable governments to take people civilian society doesn \u2019 t want to deal with anymore and stash them out of sight so that average citizens can forget about them . That enables truly horrendous conditions . Groups of prisoners in Washington , DC , and Texas are so desperate that they \u2019 ve sued for access to soap , cleaning supplies , and toilet paper amid the pandemic . \u201c On at least one unit , a closet full of cleaning supplies and clean rags is present , but residents are told they will be punished if they attempt to access or use those supplies to clean the unit , their own cells , or their hands and bodies , \u201d the DC lawsuit alleges .\nThese conditions are hardly new \u2014 a one-sheet-per-day rationing of toilet paper and a ban on showering more than once a week were among policies at Attica state prison in New York that sparked a 1971 prisoner takeover there . But this neglect is increasingly deadly in a pandemic .\nNursing homes are not necessarily an injustice , and there are plenty of valid reasons for families to place relatives there , or for residents to ask to be placed in homes . My family is no exception . But the same mechanisms through which nursing homes ease pressure on family caregivers make them places where widespread neglect is possible . Richard Mollot , an advocate for long-term care patients , notes that about one-third of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to nursing homes reported suffering some kind of harm within two weeks of entering the home .\n\u201c These are the short-term residents for whom homes are paid the most and who are typically most able to articulate their concerns if something is wrong , \u201d Mollot writes . \u201c Where does that leave a majority of residents who are there long-term , most of whom are older , frail and cognitively impaired ? \u201d\nWarehousing leaves its victims vulnerable to Covid-19 through at least two mechanisms . First , it forces affected individuals into close proximity with one another \u2014 including those maintaining the warehouse , like factory farm workers or prison guards or nursing home attendants . It \u2019 s difficult to socially distance under those conditions .\nBut the second mechanism is subtler and arguably just as important . Warehousing fosters social inequality , and we know that social inequality kills .\nPandemics are times of scarcity . Tests are scarce , doctors and nurses are scarce , masks and gloves are scarce . And scarce goods tend to be distributed according to existing social inequalities , because those inequalities reflect varying levels of respect paid to various groups by governments , businesses , and other social decision-makers .\nSo it is with coronavirus . It \u2019 s fairly well-known at this point that Covid-19 has disproportionately affected black Americans . Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that of Covid-19 patients for whom race is known , 30 percent are African American , more than double African Americans \u2019 share of the overall population .\nWhat factory farms , prisons , and nursing homes have in common is that they \u2019 re warehousing efforts\nUnauthorized immigrants in detention , or working close-proximity jobs at farms and as delivery staff , or just existing in the US without access to most of the social safety net , are uniquely vulnerable too , and not just in the US but in many rich countries . Many report fear of seeking out health care because of the risk that their status will be uncovered .\nWe see the same inequalities with factory farms , nursing homes , and prisons . Incarcerated people , especially ones locked up for violent offenses , have long suffered from politicians \u2019 , and the public \u2019 s , conviction that their past deeds make them undeserving of help . That \u2019 s especially true now , with grave consequences for both them and their guards .\nNursing home patients are victims not just of density but of a broader societal disregard toward older people and those with disabilities . Texas Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick famously suggested that Americans 70 and older should be willing to die to get the economy back running again .\nMeanwhile , the Covid-19 outbreaks at factory farms aren \u2019 t among their animals but among their workers and those at meatpacking facilities , who are disproportionately black , Latino , and/or immigrants . Warehousing hurts the people enlisted to do the warehousing , too . ( And , it should be noted , even though the novel coronavirus didn \u2019 t originate in a factory farm , factory farms are a pretty big pandemic risk \u2014 if not this pandemic , it may well be the next one . )\nNone of this is an accident . Social inequality , as the political theorist Judith Shklar taught us , fosters cruelty . In unequal societies , where one group of individuals is privileged in power above others , that power differential creates the social estrangement necessary for the powerful to treat the less powerful with cruelty .\nBut social equality can remedy social cruelty . \u201c If such social distances create the climate for cruelty , then a greater equality might be a remedy , \u201d she wrote . \u201c Even Machiavelli had known that one can not rule one \u2019 s equals with cruelty , but only one \u2019 s inferior subjects . \u201d\nCovid-19 is not simply a natural disaster . It is a brutal reminder of the consequences of inequality Shklar identified . And it is a reminder that things can be different . The US can shrink its prisons . It can create housing laws , social supports , and other structures that enable older people to live with their families whenever possible . It can abolish factory farming , for both the animals \u2019 and the workers \u2019 sakes .\nPandemics are social phenomena , and addressing pandemics requires attacking social inequalities head-on .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588-mark Sign up for the newsletter Future Perfect Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week .

        "topic": "Congress is finally wising up to the scale of the coronavirus disaster \u2014 with 1 big exception",
        "date": "2020-04-08",
        "content": "Since late February , Congress and President Trump have passed three bills in response to the coronavirus pandemic : A modest $ 8.3 billion investment in the public health response , then about $ 100 billion to beef up food stamps , state Medicaid budgets , unemployment benefits , and provide some limited paid leave . The third package , the CARES Act , was a whopping $ 2.2 trillion in aid that threw gobs of money at American households and businesses alike .\nNow Congress is discussing a fourth bill \u2014 `` CARES 2 '' as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Cali . ) is calling it \u2014 that could `` easily '' clear $ 1 trillion . This is good news : As gargantuan as the third phase was , it 's already proving itself to be grossly inadequate . And the ideas both parties are throwing out for the fourth iteration are surprisingly reasonable . Up to a point , anyway .\nAs of Monday , Democrats were pushing for a number of items : A further increase in unemployment benefits and more direct cash aid to American households . There were n't hard numbers yet , but those policies will need to be in the hundreds of billions . Democrats are also looking at about $ 250 billion to help out budgets for smaller city and town governments . These measures would all repeat aspects of the CARES Act , which sent a one-time payment of $ 1,200 to millions of Americans , added an additional $ 600 per week to unemployment benefits for the next four months ( while opening unemployment benefits up to gig workers and independent contractors ) and gave $ 130 billion to hospital systems as well as $ 150 billion for state and local budgets .\nThe thing is , the crisis has come so hard and fast that these moves , as admirable as they were , are already inadequate . Between March 14 and 28 , almost 10 million Americans filed for jobless claims . State unemployment insurance systems have been overwhelmed , and former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen reportedly told Pelosi the true unemployment rate ( that government statistics just have n't caught up to yet ) is likely 13 percent \u2014 higher than the Great Recession 's peak of 10 percent . State and local budgets , which can not deficit spend the way the federal government can , are already looking at massive spending cuts to offset the tax revenue losses . A one-time cash stipend will not be enough \u2014 it will need to be repeated several times \u2014 and America 's unemployment insurance systems will need to provide more help longer as well . As for state and local governments , they spend about $ 3.7 trillion a year in total , so a $ 400 billion infusion between the two packages seems like the bare minimum .\nAlong with those repeats of the CARES Act , Democrats reportedly also want additions like mandated hazard pay for health workers and other Americans in essential employment , and strengthened workplace safety regulations to protect them . Though it 's less obvious they 'll be able to get those passed GOP opposition .\nSpeaking of the Republican Party , they 'd like more money to go into the Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP ) \u2014 the $ 350 billion the CARES Act devoted to helping small businesses afford rent and bills and keep workers on payroll while the nation-wide quarantines have effectively turned off economic activity . It 's a critical policy for making sure America 's social fabric and civic life is still largely intact and able to function once the coronavirus pandemic has passed .\nUnfortunately , the PPP got off to a very rocky start last week , and it seems pretty clear that $ 350 billion will not be nearly enough to do what the program set out to do . Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio have already called for another $ 200 billion to add to the pot . Though it 's worth noting the PPP actually provides its aid via loans that will ultimately be forgiven , and the Federal Reserve has already said it will start buying that debt to get it off the books of the lending banks . That commitment should technically render additional money from Congress redundant \u2014 Republicans could simply call for legislative language making it clear the Fed is expected to backstop all lending done by the PPP , effectively removing any dollar cap on the aid .\nIf it 's not already obvious , all of these are worthwhile and necessary proposals both sides should be comfortable with \u2014 though Lord knows it took some doing to get the GOP on board with the unemployment benefits boost and direct cash aid . This all should provide a pretty clear path to a deal on a fourth package , and both Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) sound like they think an agreement is well within reach .\nInterestingly , Democrats in particular have evolved a lot in their requests for a fourth package over the last few weeks . Originally , they were talking about doing a big infrastructure bill to jumpstart the economy \u2014 something President Trump was enthusiastic about , but not Senate Republicans . It 's a complicated question of details and timing : A massive infrastructure investment is a great idea once the pandemic is over and the economy needs to be driven back to full employment as fast as possible . But it is n't really viable while workers need to remain under quarantine . Yet Pelosi is also right that certain infrastructure needs \u2014 `` clean water , more broadband , the rest of that '' \u2014 arguably need to be fixed right now while the pandemic is ongoing .\nThe Democratic Party leadership apparently backed off the idea of an infrastructure push once the scale of the economic catastrophe became apparent . Which is to their credit , but also suggests they 've been overly rosy about the nature of the crisis and the needed response . It also sounds like Pelosi retreated out of a desire to maintain bipartisan comity : `` Right now , I think that we have a good model , '' she told reporters on Friday . `` It was bipartisan , it was signed by the president . ''\nThat last part is unsettling . Pelosi 's other ideas \u2014 hazard pay , worker safety regulations , water and broadband infrastructure \u2014 are all worthy things Democrats should be willing to fight for . ( Food stamps could use another boost as well . ) But an overeager desire for bipartisanship could wind up leaving them on the cutting room floor .\nAnd this applies in spades to the question of vote-by-mail efforts : The coronavirus pandemic could wreak havoc on Americans ' ability to participate in the November election if voting by mail is n't an option nationally , and several billion will be needed to make that happen . But Republican politicians are ferociously opposed , and more or less openly admit that they win more with lower voter turnout .\nIt 's great that we may be able to pass another big aid package with relatively little partisan rancor . But that does n't mean bipartisanship is a worthy goal for its own sake .\nIn the case of the vote-by-mail issue , the legitimacy of American democracy is genuinely at risk . And the only leverage that House Democrats have here is their willingness to hold up the fourth aid package until the GOP caves on these more politically touchy questions . It 's admirable that Pelosi and the Democratic leadership are uncomfortable with mimicking Republican intransigence , but sometimes hardball tactics are entirely justified .",

        "topic": "'Cardiac Arrests up 800 Percent': 600+ Doctors Warn Lockdowns Doing Much More Damage Than COVID",
        "date": "2020-05-20",
        "content": "A new grassroots organization of doctors is telling the nation it needs a second opinion about the way to handle this pandemic medically and mentally .\nDuring a media call , several of these doctors spoke of horrible medical results for people because of excessive panic over the coronavirus . They also told of harm done to ill or injured people because the medical world has been largely cut off to them while almost all resources have been redirected to deal exclusively with COVID-19 .\nDr. Simone Gold is an emergency room physician documenting these harms as she \u2019 s contacted fellow medical professionals across the country and helped form this new group A Doctor A Day .\n\u201c People are not getting their health care , \u201d Gold shared . \u201c We \u2019 re so worried about the fact that patients believe that they are going to get sick if they show up for medical tests . But they \u2019 re actually hurting themselves . \u201d\n\u201c There are all these patients out there not showing up to emergency departments , \u201d Gold stated , saying where she works , \u201c The volume in the emergency department is incredibly low . Maybe 60 percent of what it usually is . And this is across the nation . Everybody \u2019 s had the same experience , excluding the New York metropolitan area . \u201d\n\u201c Actually , it \u2019 s quite empty , \u201d she reported , saying of her own hospital , \u201c I got a letter just this last week that we are firing 50 percent of our technicians . \u201d\nLayoffs have been widespread in hospitals across the country since the pandemic hit .\nMore than 600 of these physicians involved with A Doctor A Day have sent a letter to President Trump , asking his coronavirus task force to keep in mind the full implications of a shutdown .\nIn that letter , they warn millions of Americans are endangered by much of the medical world being cut off from them or by them cutting themselves off from it .\nThe letter says , \u201c These include 150,000 Americans per month who would have had a new cancer detected through a routine screening that hasn \u2019 t happened , millions who have missed routine dental care to fix problems strongly linked to heart disease/death , and preventable cases of stroke , heart attack , and child abuse . Suicide hotline phone calls have increased 600 % . \u201d\nThe letter includes actual cases from the doctors \u2019 own practices :\n\u201c Patient A.F . has chronic but previously stable health conditions . Her elective hip replacement was delayed , which caused her to become sedentary , resulting in a pulmonary embolism in April . ''\n\u201c Patient R.T. is an elderly nursing home patient , who had a small stroke in early March but was expected to make a nearly complete recovery . Since the shutdown , he has had no physical or speech therapy , and no visitors . He has lost weight , and is deteriorating rather than making progress . \u201d\nFlattening the Curve Made Sense , but Not Much Has Since\nIn the media call , Gold spoke of the goal America was originally given when everyone was told they must \u201c flatten the curve. \u201d That goal was making sure hospitals weren \u2019 t overwhelmed by potentially millions of people dangerously ill from the coronavirus .\nShe agreed with that goal when it was first voiced , saying , \u201c I always was concerned if we \u2019 d have enough ventilators and ICU staff . That was always what I knew to be the potential problem . So I was encouraged when people said that we were going to try to slow things down for that particular reason . That makes medical sense . Everything that has followed since that does not make scientific sense and is flat-out detrimental to society . \u201d\n\u201c I can not say strongly enough that the healthcare system not only is not overwhelmed , it is underwhelmed , \u201d Gold insisted . \u201c I can tell you of scores of nurses who \u2019 ve been laid off and scores of technicians who \u2019 ve been laid off . And in my specialty , emergency physicians have cut their hours by 35 percent . I \u2019 ve never seen anything like this in my career . My point is : the curve has been flattened . \u201d\n\u201c The reality is that we are way past the time where being locked down makes any scientific or medical sense , \u201d said Dr. Jeff Barke , a primary care physician in Newport Beach , California .\nHe talked up the idea of herd immunity and addressed what he sees as the danger and illogic of keeping children and young people locked up .\n\u201c We are taking the healthiest folks \u2013 the youngest , the strongest : our children \u2013 and we are in effect protecting the healthiest herd from being exposed and allowing them to get herd immunity , \u201d Barke argued . \u201c We \u2019 re seeing over and over , especially with the statistics on children , that children are almost completely spared from the ravages of this virus . \u201d\nSanta Monica pediatrician Robert Hamilton added to the point , saying , \u201c COVID-19 has actually been a relatively benign infection for children . In one study of about 150,000 people , only 1.7 percent of them were in the age category between zero and 18 years of age . \u201d\nHe pointed out those few young people infected were for the most part asymptomatic , meaning the small number who were sickened were , as he put it , \u201c a tiny minority of a tiny minority . \u201d\nPediatrician Assures Children Won \u2019 t \u2018 Infect All of Us & Kill Us All \u2019\nBut the fact that most children will by asymptomatic has caused the fear that if schools open up again and most of the students get infected , they \u2019 ll unknowingly carry the virus to the people who could be hurt or even killed by it .\nOr , as Hamilton paraphrased those who worry about such a thing , \u201c \u2019 Oh my gosh , children are the ones who are going to infect all of us and kill us all ! \u2019 \u201d\nHamilton said of that , \u201c There was a recent study following a child who turned positive in the French Alps . He was exposed to over a hundred people . None of them turned positive. \u201d The pediatrician also cited a study done in Iceland that shows basically the same results .\nHe suggested these studies say of infected children , \u201c They are not what I call \u2018 the bubonic plague rodents \u2019 that we sometimes look at them as. \u2019 Children are not actually the cause of the problem\u2026they \u2019 re not the super-spreaders that people sometimes think . \u201d\nSo he argues for schools opening sooner rather than later .\nThis new group A Doctor A Day is also pointing out how halting most so-called \u201c non-essential \u201d surgeries and treatments during the pandemic can cause multiple medical crises .\nGold explained , \u201c There are problems pushing off what \u2019 s called \u2018 an elective surgery. \u2019 That \u2019 s a very gray area . Things go from \u2018 elective \u2019 to \u2018 urgent \u2019 rapidly . \u201d\nDr. Steven Giannotta echoed what Gold said , speaking of the crucial surgeries done by him and his associates at a hospital at the University of Southern California : surgeries for cancer , brain aneurysms , brain tumors , heart and liver transplants , and stroke care .\n\u201c When the lockdown came , we dutifully reduced our capacity to approximately 30 percent of normal , \u201d Giannotta reported . \u201c All of those patients who were in the pipeline to have their cancer treated or their brain aneurysm treated or their spinal condition treated were all put on hold . \u201d\nAnd that put many of those patients at increased risk .\nOn the flip side , the care Giannotta was not willing to see cut back involves stroke victims . But many of those people just aren \u2019 t showing up to get examined and get care . `` Which means people are sitting at home with potential symptoms of stroke and are , for whatever reason , refusing to access the healthcare system , '' Giannotta explained .\nMedia \u2019 s Made Being COVID Positive Feel More Dangerous Than It Is\nHe put much of the blame for that on news coverage , saying , \u201c We \u2019 ve allowed the media to try to stigmatize COVID positivity . \u201d\nMany people are already afraid they \u2019 ll get the virus at a medical office or in a hospital , and Giannotta charged media link getting the COVID virus to death : \u201c They \u2019 ve stigmatized now our healthcare system and people are afraid to access the healthcare system for fear of becoming COVID positive , as if that is the worst possible outcome . \u201d\nBut he pointed out the odds for most people dying from COVID-19 are actually statistically very low , \u201c Whereas all of our patients with care for their brain tumors being delayed and along with our stroke victims , who are unfortunately suffering strokes because they won \u2019 t access the healthcare system , are being very severely impacted by these lockdown tactics . \u201d\nThey \u2019 re Hurting Their Heart for Fear of the Virus Hurting Them\nSpeaking of heart conditions , Gold added , \u201c Why are we not concerned patients are not showing up at their cardiologist \u2019 s when it \u2019 s well-known if you don \u2019 t go to the cardiologist 's regularly , your heart disease will worsen ? Why are we not concerned about the stroke patients that are having strokes at home , not getting treated or dying ? \u201d\n\u201c Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States , \u201d cardiologist Gabe Vorobiof at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles pointed out .\nSpeaking of those suffering from heart conditions , he reported they \u2019 re not keeping their doctors \u2019 appointments or going to hospitals because \u201c there are a huge number of patients that are simply terrified of what the media is putting out and they \u2019 re terrified of contracting this infection . \u201d\nThe results of that are deadly . \u201c In-home cardiac arrests in the New York area are up 800 percent , \u201d Vorobiof shared . \u201c The majority of those cardiac arrest patients were not revived. \u201d In other words , they died .\n\u201c Ambulatory cardiology practices have seen about a 60 percent decline in patient volumes since late March . We \u2019 ve seen across-the-board reductions in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarctions ( heart attacks ) , \u201d Vorobiof reported , saying the same is true of those suffering strokes . \u201c We \u2019 ve also seen reduction of patient visits for valve disease and transcatheter valve replacement . Procedures are way down . \u201d\nGold introduced psychiatrist Dr. Mark McDonald , saying , \u201c He \u2019 s had patients commit suicide because of depression and picking up drug use again . \u201d\nMcDonald runs a practice in West Los Angeles for children , adolescents , and other young people . He said during the lockdown , \u201c I have had probably a 50 percent decline in patient visits due to patients being scared of coming to the office . These are children , adolescents , and young adults . They \u2019 re worried that if they get the coronavirus infection , they \u2019 ll die . And that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re hearing in the media and that \u2019 s what their parents are telling them . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c And this is not isolated . I \u2019 ve had many patients call me recently in a state of panic . They don \u2019 t know what to do . They \u2019 re drinking again . They \u2019 re thinking of jumping off a bridge . They \u2019 re really suffering and there \u2019 s very little I can do . I have nowhere to send them because there are no resources available . Often they won \u2019 t even come into the office . \u201d\n\u201c This , in my view , is a pandemic of hysteria and emotional overwhelm , \u201d McDonald stated . \u201c It \u2019 s not a medical pandemic . But the downstream consequences medically are very , very severe . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s an emotional and social toll that this is taking on children , being in lockdown for this period of time , \u201d said pediatrician Hamilton , backing up McDonald . \u201c Issues of depression , suicide threats , that sense of futility , despair , fear , paranoia really , are taking ahold in our younger people , particularly older kids , junior high and high school ages . \u201d\nPsychiatrist McDonald added , \u201c I \u2019 ve had to increase my frequency and dosage of benzodiazepines , which is the valium and Xanax family of drugs , which are highly addictive , in order to treat overwhelming increases of panic attacks , obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms , and generalized anxiety . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c I hate using these drugs ; I \u2019 m very conservative in my prescribing them . But I don \u2019 t have any choice because patients have no other resources . A lot of my patients have had substance abuse issues . They have nowhere to go . All of the AA meetings , 12-Step programs , outpatient and inpatient substance abuse programs -- they \u2019 re done . There \u2019 s nothing . \u201d\nMcDonald told of a 31-year-old woman he treated for years for severe depression who was recently in remission and taking graduate classes to become a therapist .\nBut when her college shut down due to the pandemic and her boyfriend broke up with her , she retreated to her home alone and faced weeks with no support . She \u2019 d had a history of opioid abuse she \u2019 d kicked for several years , but recently relapsed and took fentanyl .\n\u201c Fentanyl is an opiate that \u2019 s hundreds or thousands of times more potent than prescription opiates like oxycontin or oxycodone , \u201d McDonald explained . \u201c She was found unresponsive by paramedics . At 31 years old , perfectly physically well \u2013 dead . \u201d\nThe psychiatrist stated , \u201c I am certain that the cause of her death was due to a withdrawal of support in the community and the withdrawal of her ability to be in school and her inability to handle the added stress . \u201d\nMcDonald also spoke of a suicide hotline in Los Angeles reporting in early April an increase from February to March of 20 calls to 1,800 .\nGold brought up another area of concern , saying , \u201c It \u2019 s very important that children are not getting vaccinated . We keep talking about a coronavirus vaccine . Why are we not concerned that children are falling off their vaccination schedules ? \u201d\n\u201c Vaccination rates really globally are very , very down , \u201d stated pediatrician Hamilton .\nFor example , talking about what \u2019 s in a recent New York Times article , he shared , \u201c In Michigan , less than half of infants five months or younger are really up to date on their immunizations right now . \u201d\nHe went on , \u201c Because of the fear of potential infection with COVID , people are not coming to the doctor and they \u2019 re forgetting about the maintenance of their vaccines as scheduled . \u201d\nHamilton also argued that long lockdowns are hurting many children educationally .\nHe spoke of disturbing numbers brought out in a Los Angeles Times article , saying , \u201c After the L.A. Unified School District went to an online system in mid-March , they were showing that large swaths of their high school students weren \u2019 t even checking in . 15,000 of them simply disappeared . They were gone . They had not checked in one time . Another 40,000 of their students \u2013 which represents about a third of their student body \u2013 really were not in daily contact with their teachers . The quality of their education is in fact really lagging . \u201d\nDoctor Argues Keeping Schools Shut \u2018 Just Makes No Scientific Sense Whatever \u2019\nBarke weighed in on this issue of keeping schools closed , saying of those killed by the coronavirus , \u201c The number of deaths younger than 40 are very , very tiny . And if you look at the number of deaths less than ( age ) 40 compared to almost anything else \u2013 whether it be traffic accidents or other forms of death \u2013 compared to COVID-19 , it \u2019 s just ridiculously low for COVID-19 . So this idea that somehow we have to wait for a vaccination or a cure for this virus in order to open up schools just makes no scientific sense whatever . \u201d\nSome on the other side of these pandemic-related issues warn throwing the schools open and purposely exposing people to the virus to get herd immunity are dangerous .\nBarke does admit the idea of herd immunity being foolproof isn \u2019 t 100 percent guaranteed . \u201c But we have examples of past respiratory viral infections where we \u2019 ve been able to reach a level of herd immunity to protect the most vulnerable . \u201d\n\u201c For every child and for every young adult that is locked indoors and is not allowed to be exposed to the virus where they overwhelmingly do well , especially if you \u2019 re younger than the age of 40 or even 50 , that \u2019 s one person less to achieve that level of herd immunity , \u201d Barke argued .\nHe concluded , \u201c Even if we don \u2019 t get up to the recommended 60 or 70 or 80 percent of immunity within the population , even if we only reach 30 or 40 percent , that \u2019 s 30 or 40 percent of Americans that are exposed , that are immune , and are no longer able to spread the virus . And are able in some regard to protect the most vulnerable because there \u2019 s less of a medium to spread it to them . \u201d\nAt the website of this new grassroots group of doctors -- adoctoraday.com -- a different medical professional will share every day about the medical harms they \u2019 ve seen in their real-world practice caused by a continued shutdown of the nation .\nGold said of all these harms , \u201c That is also part of the COVID-19 story , and we are very concerned that decision-makers are not hearing that . \u201d\n\u201c I found that this is not something that \u2019 s widely reported in the media at all , \u201d Gold said , concluding , \u201c I feel there \u2019 s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what \u2019 s actually going on . \u201d\nGold shared one case of inadvertent harm caused by the way Americans have been denied so many services they \u2019 ve been accustomed to . She spoke of a middle-aged woman who tired of not being able to get her hair dyed like she usually did .\n\u201c She was dying her hair at home because her hairdresser was not available , \u201d Gold explained . \u201c And that \u2019 s an awkward thing to do , and she turned and she fell and she broke her hip and she broke her shoulder . And that \u2019 s how I met her : in the emergency department with both of these fractures , and she needed surgery . And I have thousands and thousands of these stories . \u201d\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE \u2588\u2588\u2588 NEWS APP !\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Live Events",

The polling place served two precincts as voters who were scheduled to vote at a nearby senior living facility were directed to vote at the church after the facility backed out due to coronavirus concerns . ( AP Photo/Charlie Riedel )\nCOLUMBUS , Ohio ( AP ) \u2014 The coronavirus threat is forcing elections officials in some states to remove polling places from nursing homes and other senior care facilities to protect older Americans , who appear to be more susceptible to the disease .\nLast-minute shuffling left voters in Michigan and Missouri scrambling to get to new polling places for their Tuesday primaries . Officials in states voting next week are trying to get ahead of those disruptions by announcing changes now and beginning public information campaigns to tell voters where they are supposed to cast ballots .\nIn Ohio , the elections chief on Monday ordered the relocation of all polling places at nursing homes \u2014 more than 140 \u2014 just eight days ahead of the state \u2019 s primary .\n\u201c Obviously , that \u2019 s a big step and it requires a lot of work \u2014 and our county boards of elections are working to do that right now , as we speak , \u201d Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose told reporters Tuesday .\nMoving the polling places may be the right public health move , but it creates challenges for election administrators . Those include informing voters in surrounding areas of the change and ensuring that retirement community residents have transportation to their new polling location .\nSecretaries of state across the country are taking further steps to guard public health : encouraging voting from a distance , either by mail or by using curbside drop-off locations ; creating and updating dedicated websites ; partnering with voting rights organizations and campaigns to get the word out ; and stocking up on supplies for disinfecting voting machines .\nIn Missouri , officials had to react quickly after two senior living facilities backed out of serving as voting sites less than 24 hours before polls opened for Tuesday \u2019 s presidential primary . Election authorities posted signs at the senior facilities redirecting voters to new polling places nearby .\nA spokeswoman for Brookdale Senior Living , the Kansas City facility \u2019 s operator , said the company adopted a policy Monday prohibiting groups of three or more people from entering any of its more than 700 facilities nationwide because of coronavirus concerns .\nBrookdale also suspended all planned group outings , meaning it couldn \u2019 t take residents by bus to the new voting location . Some residents drove themselves or got rides from relatives or friends to the alternative polling place .\nIn Michigan , two private senior facilities requested that polling places in their buildings be relocated because of coronavirus concerns , Secretary of State spokesman Jake Rollow said in an email .\nFor most people , the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough . For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia . The vast majority of people who get it recover .\nAs Arizona , Florida , Illinois and Ohio prepare to vote next week , officials are taking varying approaches to the virus threat .\nIn Florida \u2019 s Palm Beach County , elections supervisor Wendy Sartory Link is moving 16 polling places out of assisted living facilities so their patients will not be exposed to voters from the community . She has found replacements for 10 at schools , churches and city halls , and believes she \u2019 ll be able to relocate the other six .\n\u201c The health and safety of their residents have to come first , \u201d she said .\nThe moves are being complicated because Link \u2019 s poll workers contain a large percentage of senior citizens and many are backing out , fearing infection . She hopes they can be replaced , but isn \u2019 t certain .\nIn Lake County , where a quarter of the population is over 65 , elections supervisor Alan Hays said relocation is not necessary . Only residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities vote there , he said , so they are shielded from outsiders even under normal circumstances .\nThe state \u2019 s most populous county , Miami-Dade , also has no plans to move any polling places because of the virus . Steven Vancore , a spokesman for the elections supervisor in Broward County , said just one polling place at an assisted living facility was being relocated at the management \u2019 s request .\nIn Illinois , Gov . J.B. Pritzker said the state has asked all 108 local boards of elections to extend the deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot until Monday . He also said the state and the city of Chicago will help move polling places out of nursing homes and other senior facilities , while ensuring that residents still can cast ballots there .\n\u201c We \u2019 re doing our best to accommodate everybody to make sure that we get the kind of vote turnout that we expect , \u201d he said .\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said her administration was urging the city \u2019 s Board of Election Commissioners to extend its deadline for requesting mail-in ballots . She also suggested voters use in-person early voting locations .\nMarisel Hernandez , chair of the election commission , said Wednesday that 25 of the city \u2019 s 269 polling sites , including nursing homes , must be relocated before Tuesday . Chicago officials expressed doubt about extending their deadline to request a mail-in ballot until Monday , as the governor and mayor suggested , because they said that would put pressure on the postal service and voters .\nElection officials in the Phoenix area moved five polling places from assisted living or other senior care facilities to protect those residents from the virus , according to the Maricopa County Elections Department , but about eight in 10 voters there cast ballots by mail , limiting polling site traffic .\nAmber McReynolds , a former Denver election administrator who is now executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute , an advocacy group , said the changes being made during the primaries should be a prelude to even bigger changes in November , when turnout will be greater .\nShe said it \u2019 s not enough just to encourage people to request absentee ballots . Rather , she said officials should try to do what a handful of states -- Colorado , Hawaii , Oregon , Utah and Washington \u2014 already do : Mail ballots to every voter .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute \u2019 s Department of Science Education .
