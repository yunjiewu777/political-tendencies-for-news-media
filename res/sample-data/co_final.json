        "content": "COLUMBUS , Ohio -- Gov . Mike DeWine on Monday recommended that Ohio 's primaries , which are scheduled to take place on Tuesday , be postponed until June 2 in order to protect voters from the coronavirus outbreak .\nDeWine made his announcement during an updated briefing on the pandemic , which has hit hard in Ohio .\nMARCH 17 PRIMARIES : HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE\nBut President Trump -- speaking at a coronavirus briefing at the White House an hour later -- said he 'd leave such decisions on postponing a primary up to the states but emphasized that `` I think postponing is unnecessary . ''\nOhio is the only one of the four states scheduled to hold presidential primaries on Tuesday to move to postpone their contest . Officials in the other states - Arizona , Florida , and Illinois - said their primaries would be held .\nDeWine explained that the decision in Ohio , ultimately , would have to be made by a judge .\nThe governor 's office was filing the lawsuit in Franklin County with the hopes that it would quickly receive court approval .\nThe governor \u2019 s move came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks .\nThe governor also said : `` It is clear that tomorrow \u2019 s in-person voting does not conform with the CDC guidelines . We can not conduct this election tomorrow , the in-person voting for 13 hours tomorrow \u2013 and conform to these guidelines . \u201d\nThe governor also emphasized that \u201c ultimately it is not fair to make people pick between their health and constitutional rights . Voters can vote by mail , and this will help us achieve the goal that people maintain their constitutional rights safely . \u201d\nDeWine also recommended that \u201c between now and then absentee ballot voting be permitted . \u201d\nMinutes after DeWine 's comments , Ohio 's secretary of state also recommended delaying the primary date until June .\nLegal authority in Ohio does not rest with the governor or secretary of state . By law a change must be enacted by either a legal order or an act of the state legislature .\nA LOOK AT FLORIDA \u2019 S PRIMARY WINNERS IN PAST PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS\nSoon after the move by DeWine to postpone primary day in Ohio , officials in Florida and Illinois announced that their contest is still on for Tuesday .\n\u201c With Ohio announcing today that it is postponing its primary , which had been scheduled for tomorrow , I wanted to let you know that Illinois is proceeding with plans for tomorrow \u2019 s primary as scheduled , \u201d Illinois State Board of Elections public information officer Matt Dietrich wrote in an email to reporters .\nDietrich highlighted that as of Monday 504,000 early votes had already been cast and that 294,000 mail ballots had been sent to voters . Both figures were significantly higher than in the 2016 primary .\n\u201c With early voting continuing today , we likely will see a substantial increase when early voting sites close . We along with the state \u2019 s 108 local election authorities had been encouraging early voting for several weeks and in the past two weeks had increased our efforts so voters could vote early and avoid lines and crowds on election day out of concern for coronavirus , \u201d he emphasized .\nIn justifying the decision to go forward with the primary , Dietrich noted that \u201c much of the voting for this election already has been done . Also , at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty . \u201d\nAnd pointing to Illinois Gov . Jay Pritzker \u2019 s order to close restaurants and bars except for carryout service , he said \u201c we want to point out that in-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store . There is no need for close contact when requesting a ballot from an election judge and Illinois does not require voters to show ID ; a voter \u2019 s signature compared to the signature on record is proof of identity . Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters . \u201d\nFlorida \u2019 s Department of State told Fox News \u201c we are moving forward \u201d with their primary .\nEarlier Monday , Secretary of State Laurel M Lee tweeted \u201c we are aware of voters \u2019 concerns over # COVID19 . FL Dept of Health has assured healthy Floridians it \u2019 s safe to work the polls for & vote in Tuesday \u2019 s election .

        "content_original": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday recommended that Ohio's primaries, which are scheduled to take place on Tuesday, be postponed until June 2 in order to protect voters from the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDeWine made his announcement during an updated briefing on the pandemic, which has hit hard in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe cannot conduct this election tomorrow,\u201d he stressed.\n\nMARCH 17 PRIMARIES: HERE ARE THE STATES VOTING AND THE DELEGATES AT STAKE\n\nBut President Trump -- speaking at a coronavirus briefing at the White House an hour later -- said he'd leave such decisions on postponing a primary up to the states but emphasized that \"I think postponing is unnecessary.\"\n\nOhio is the only one of the four states scheduled to hold presidential primaries on Tuesday to move to postpone their contest. Officials in the other states - Arizona, Florida, and Illinois - said their primaries would be held.\n\nDeWine explained that the decision in Ohio, ultimately, would have to be made by a judge.\n\nThe governor's office was filing the lawsuit in Franklin County with the hopes that it would quickly receive court approval.\n\nThe governor\u2019s move came a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday recommended against holding gatherings of 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.\n\nSTATES THAT HAVE POSTPONED PRIMARIES DUE TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nThe governor also said: \"It is clear that tomorrow\u2019s in-person voting does not conform with the CDC guidelines. We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in-person voting for 13 hours tomorrow \u2013 and conform to these guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe governor also emphasized that \u201cultimately it is not fair to make people pick between their health and constitutional rights. Voters can vote by mail, and this will help us achieve the goal that people maintain their constitutional rights safely.\u201d\n\nDeWine also recommended that \u201cbetween now and then absentee ballot voting be permitted.\u201d\n\nMinutes after DeWine's comments, Ohio's secretary of state also recommended delaying the primary date until June.\n\nLegal authority in Ohio does not rest with the governor or secretary of state. By law a change must be enacted by either a legal order or an act of the state legislature.\n\nA LOOK AT FLORIDA\u2019S PRIMARY WINNERS IN PAST PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS\n\nSoon after the move by DeWine to postpone primary day in Ohio, officials in Florida and Illinois announced that their contest is still on for Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWith Ohio announcing today that it is postponing its primary, which had been scheduled for tomorrow, I wanted to let you know that Illinois is proceeding with plans for tomorrow\u2019s primary as scheduled,\u201d Illinois State Board of Elections public information officer Matt Dietrich wrote in an email to reporters.\n\nDietrich highlighted that as of Monday 504,000 early votes had already been cast and that 294,000 mail ballots had been sent to voters. Both figures were significantly higher than in the 2016 primary.\n\n\u201cWith early voting continuing today, we likely will see a substantial increase when early voting sites close. We along with the state\u2019s 108 local election authorities had been encouraging early voting for several weeks and in the past two weeks had increased our efforts so voters could vote early and avoid lines and crowds on election day out of concern for coronavirus,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nIn justifying the decision to go forward with the primary, Dietrich noted that \u201cmuch of the voting for this election already has been done. Also, at this point there is no date in the foreseeable future when we can expect greater safety with any certainty.\u201d\n\nAnd pointing to Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker\u2019s order to close restaurants and bars except for carryout service, he said \u201cwe want to point out that in-person voting is a comparable transaction to picking up a takeout restaurant order or shopping at a grocery store. There is no need for close contact when requesting a ballot from an election judge and Illinois does not require voters to show ID; a voter\u2019s signature compared to the signature on record is proof of identity. Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s Department of State told Fox News \u201cwe are moving forward\u201d with their primary.\n\nEarlier Monday, Secretary of State Laurel M Lee tweeted \u201cwe are aware of voters\u2019 concerns over #COVID19. FL Dept of Health has assured healthy Floridians it\u2019s safe to work the polls for & vote in Tuesday\u2019s election. Supervisors of Elections are ensuring polls are prepared for voters.\u201d\n\nArizona Gov. Steve Ducey announced at an afternoon news conference that their primary would be held.\n\n\"We\u2019ve made sure that election officials have the equipment and the support they need for the polling places to function tomorrow. Our elected leaders have been working overtime to ensure that voting is safe,\" the governor said.\n\nSecretary of State Katie Hobbs explained \"this decision was not made lightly and what it all comes down to is that we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future.\"\n\n\"There are thousands of workers across the state that must continue the job of counting the ballots in the days following the election. The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous this becomes,\" she emphasized.\n\nEarlier in the day, she tweeted instructions and suggestions for voters to stay safe avoid contracting the coronavirus while casting their ballot.\n\nOver a couple of days, Georgia, Louisana and Puerto Rico -- which have upcoming contests -- have delayed their primaries until later in the spring.\n\nBiden's election eve lead\n\nJoe Biden holds a commanding lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders in Arizona, according to two new polls released on the eve of that state\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nA Monmouth University survey released on Monday shows the former vice president with 51 percent support among likely Democratic presidential primary voters. Sanders \u2013 the populist lawmaker from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight White House run \u2013 stands at 31 percent. That's 20 percentage points behind Biden.\n\nAnd Biden leads Sanders by 17 points \u2013 53-36 percent \u2013 in an NBC News/Marist poll that also released on Monday. Sixty-seven pledged delegates are up for grabs in Arizona.\n\nBiden tops Sanders 58-35 percent in an NBC News/Marist poll in Ohio, where 136 pledged delegates are at stake if the contest is held.\n\nThe most recent polls in Florida and Illinois also indicated Biden enjoying large double-digit leads over Sanders.\n\nAn NBC News/Wall Street Journal national survey released on Sunday showed Biden with a nearly two-to-one advantage over Sanders in the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn the last two and a half weeks, Sanders has watched Biden zoom past him in the race for the presidential nomination.

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) April 21 , 2020 Report\nMr Trump 's announcement late on Monday came as the White House argued that the worst of the pandemic was over and the country could begin reopening . The restrictions on people 's movement , implemented by many states to curb the spread of the virus , have paralysed parts of the economy .\nOver the past four weeks , more than 20 million Americans have registered for unemployment benefits . That amounts to roughly as many jobs as employers had added over the previous decade .\nThe US has more than 787,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and more than 42,000 deaths , according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University , which is tracking the pandemic globally .\nA Trump campaign statement on Tuesday said the move had two functions - to prevent competition for jobs that could add to dole queues and depress wages , and stop imported infections .\nIt was not immediately clear who could be affected by Mr Trump 's announcement or when such a move could come into force .\nAccording to the New York Times , citing several people familiar with the plan , a formal order temporarily barring the provision of new green cards and work visas could be one way of implementing the measure ; the administration would no longer approve any applications from foreigners to live and work in the US for an undetermined period of time .\nLast month , the US suspended almost all visa processing , including for immigrants , because of the pandemic .\nThe US has already agreed with both Canada and Mexico to extend border restrictions on non-essential travel until at least mid-May .\nTravel has also been sharply restricted from hard-hit European countries and China , though people with temporary work visas , students and business travellers are exempted .\nOn Monday , the US said it would continue to expel migrants it encounters along the border with Mexico for at least another month .\nIn recent weeks , emergency powers have been used to expel thousands of undocumented migrants on the US southern border . The public health measure lets officials override immigration laws , expediting removal processes .\nLast year , just over one million people were granted lawful permanent resident status in the US , according to the Department of Homeland Security . The top countries of origin were Mexico , China , India , the Dominican Republic , the Philippines and Cuba .\nMore than half of those , though , were cases of `` adjusted status from within the US '' - meaning they were already there - and only 459,000 arrived from abroad . The latter group would be the ones presumably affected by an immigration ban .\nWhen it comes to refugees , there were 30,000 people admitted into the US in 2019 , most of them from Congo , Myanmar , Ukraine , Eritrea , Afghanistan and Syria .\nDonald Trump 's efforts at governing by social media should always be taken with a sizable grain of salt . His track record on following through on Twitter directives is decidedly mixed . The details of his temporary ban on all immigration , announced a few hours before midnight on Monday , will shed considerable light on the breadth - and legality - of his actions .\nStill , it is no secret that the president , and several key advisers , have long viewed immigration not as a benefit to the nation , but as a drain . And the text of his tweet , that the move is necessary not only to protect the nation 's health but also `` the jobs of its great American citizens '' , only emphasises this .\nThere is little doubt the proposal , in whatever form it takes , will be vigorously opposed by pro-immigration groups , some business interests and the president 's ideological adversaries . That is probably just fine with a man who loves drawing political battle lines and goading his opponents whenever possible .\nFour years ago , the president campaigned on an aggressive anti-immigration platform , including a total , if temporary , ban on all Muslims entering the country . Now , with an uphill re-election fight looming , he has found a similarly combative measure to champion .\nCriticising the ban , California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris said Mr Trump was using the outbreak to push his anti-immigrant stance .\nSkip Twitter post by @ SenKamalaHarris Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1 . His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives . And now , he 's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda .\nEnough , Mr. President . The American people are fed up . https : //t.co/pT5edXBIT5 \u2014 Kamala Harris ( @ SenKamalaHarris ) April 21 , 2020 Report\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar also condemned the decision .\nSkip Twitter post by @ amyklobuchar As our country battles the pandemic , as workers put their lives on the line , the President attacks immigrants & blames others for his own failures . The order I \u2019 d like to see tonight ? Testing . Instead he twists \u201c the buck stops here \u201d into this : \u201c the buck stops anywhere but here. \u201d \u2014 Amy Klobuchar ( @ amyklobuchar ) April 21 , 2020 Report\nJust hours after Mr Trump 's announcement , former Vice-President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter that the president should `` do his job '' , and stop seeking ways to redirect blame - an apparent reference to the immigration pause . The presumptive Democratic nominee was echoed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday who dismissed the move as `` another diversion '' .\nBut the announcement was welcomed on the Republican side . Congressman Paul Gosar , who represents Arizona , applauded the move :\nEarlier on Monday , Democratic governors asked the White House to urge Americans to heed stay-at-home orders amid anti-lockdown protests stoked by the president .\nMr Trump has been accused of inciting insurrection after championing the demonstrators , while telling governors they were in charge .\nHe has expressed his support of the protesters in recent days , even as state governors say they are following White House guidance for safely reopening in phases .\nA number of southern states in the US are in the process of easing virus-related restrictions .\nSouth Carolina has allowed some retailers , including department stores , to re-open , while most businesses in Tennessee will re-open on 1 May .\nGeorgia 's governor has said residents would be allowed to visit gyms , hairdressers and tattooists from Friday , followed by restaurants and cinemas on Monday , as long as those businesses operated within social distancing guidelines .\nThe Republican governors of all three states say social distancing measures will remain in place .\nThe WHO has previously warned about easing restrictions too early to avoid seeing a resurgence of infections .\nMr Trump - who faces an election in November - last week tweeted in all capital letters for several states to be liberated .

        "content_original": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The US has the highest number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he will sign an executive order to temporarily suspend all immigration to the US because of the coronavirus.\n\nOn Twitter, he cited \"the attack from the invisible enemy\", as he calls the virus, and the need to protect the jobs of Americans, but did not give details.\n\nIt was not clear what programmes might be affected and whether the president would be able to carry out the order.\n\nCritics say the government is using the pandemic to crack down on immigration.\n\nImmigration has traditionally been a strong campaigning theme for Mr Trump, but has taken a back seat during the pandemic and in the lead-up to the November election.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020 Report\n\nMr Trump's announcement late on Monday came as the White House argued that the worst of the pandemic was over and the country could begin reopening. The restrictions on people's movement, implemented by many states to curb the spread of the virus, have paralysed parts of the economy.\n\nOver the past four weeks, more than 20 million Americans have registered for unemployment benefits. That amounts to roughly as many jobs as employers had added over the previous decade.\n\nThe US has more than 787,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and more than 42,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the pandemic globally.\n\nHow can the proposals be implemented?\n\nA Trump campaign statement on Tuesday said the move had two functions - to prevent competition for jobs that could add to dole queues and depress wages, and stop imported infections.\n\nIt was not immediately clear who could be affected by Mr Trump's announcement or when such a move could come into force.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, citing several people familiar with the plan, a formal order temporarily barring the provision of new green cards and work visas could be one way of implementing the measure; the administration would no longer approve any applications from foreigners to live and work in the US for an undetermined period of time.\n\nLast month, the US suspended almost all visa processing, including for immigrants, because of the pandemic.\n\nThe US has already agreed with both Canada and Mexico to extend border restrictions on non-essential travel until at least mid-May.\n\nTravel has also been sharply restricted from hard-hit European countries and China, though people with temporary work visas, students and business travellers are exempted.\n\nOn Monday, the US said it would continue to expel migrants it encounters along the border with Mexico for at least another month.\n\nIn recent weeks, emergency powers have been used to expel thousands of undocumented migrants on the US southern border. The public health measure lets officials override immigration laws, expediting removal processes.\n\nLast year, just over one million people were granted lawful permanent resident status in the US, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The top countries of origin were Mexico, China, India, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines and Cuba.\n\nMore than half of those, though, were cases of \"adjusted status from within the US\" - meaning they were already there - and only 459,000 arrived from abroad. The latter group would be the ones presumably affected by an immigration ban.\n\nWhen it comes to refugees, there were 30,000 people admitted into the US in 2019, most of them from Congo, Myanmar, Ukraine, Eritrea, Afghanistan and Syria.\n\nWhat are the reasons behind the move?\n\nDonald Trump's efforts at governing by social media should always be taken with a sizable grain of salt. His track record on following through on Twitter directives is decidedly mixed. The details of his temporary ban on all immigration, announced a few hours before midnight on Monday, will shed considerable light on the breadth - and legality - of his actions.\n\nStill, it is no secret that the president, and several key advisers, have long viewed immigration not as a benefit to the nation, but as a drain. And the text of his tweet, that the move is necessary not only to protect the nation's health but also \"the jobs of its great American citizens\", only emphasises this.\n\nThere is little doubt the proposal, in whatever form it takes, will be vigorously opposed by pro-immigration groups, some business interests and the president's ideological adversaries. That is probably just fine with a man who loves drawing political battle lines and goading his opponents whenever possible.\n\nFour years ago, the president campaigned on an aggressive anti-immigration platform, including a total, if temporary, ban on all Muslims entering the country. Now, with an uphill re-election fight looming, he has found a similarly combative measure to champion.\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nCriticising the ban, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris said Mr Trump was using the outbreak to push his anti-immigrant stance.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @SenKamalaHarris Trump failed to take this crisis seriously from day 1. His abandonment of his role as president has cost lives. And now, he's shamelessly politicizing this pandemic to double down on his anti-immigrant agenda.\n\n\n\nEnough, Mr. President. The American people are fed up. https://t.co/pT5edXBIT5 \u2014 Kamala Harris (@SenKamalaHarris) April 21, 2020 Report\n\nFormer Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar also condemned the decision.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @amyklobuchar As our country battles the pandemic, as workers put their lives on the line, the President attacks immigrants & blames others for his own failures. The order I\u2019d like to see tonight? Testing. Instead he twists \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d into this: \u201cthe buck stops anywhere but here.\u201d \u2014 Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) April 21, 2020 Report\n\nJust hours after Mr Trump's announcement, former Vice-President Joe Biden wrote on Twitter that the president should \"do his job\", and stop seeking ways to redirect blame - an apparent reference to the immigration pause. The presumptive Democratic nominee was echoed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday who dismissed the move as \"another diversion\".\n\nBut the announcement was welcomed on the Republican side. Congressman Paul Gosar, who represents Arizona, applauded the move:\n\nWhat's the latest in the US?\n\nEarlier on Monday, Democratic governors asked the White House to urge Americans to heed stay-at-home orders amid anti-lockdown protests stoked by the president.\n\nMr Trump has been accused of inciting insurrection after championing the demonstrators, while telling governors they were in charge.\n\nHe has expressed his support of the protesters in recent days, even as state governors say they are following White House guidance for safely reopening in phases.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump tells reporter: A lot of people love me\n\nA number of southern states in the US are in the process of easing virus-related restrictions.\n\nSouth Carolina has allowed some retailers, including department stores, to re-open, while most businesses in Tennessee will re-open on 1 May.\n\nGeorgia's governor has said residents would be allowed to visit gyms, hairdressers and tattooists from Friday, followed by restaurants and cinemas on Monday, as long as those businesses operated within social distancing guidelines.\n\nThe Republican governors of all three states say social distancing measures will remain in place.\n\nThe WHO has previously warned about easing restrictions too early to avoid seeing a resurgence of infections.\n\nMr Trump - who faces an election in November - last week tweeted in all capital letters for several states to be liberated. At Sunday's coronavirus briefing, he said those protesting against their governors' social distancing measures were \"great people\".\n\n\"Their life was taken away from them,\" he said. \"These people love our country, they want to get back to work.\"",

        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci issued a stark warning on Tuesday to lawmakers on Capitol Hill , telling them he would n't be surprised if the US sees new cases of coronavirus rising to a level of 100,000 a day .\n`` We are now having 40-plus thousand new cases a day . I would not be surprised if we go up to 100,000 a day if this does not turn around and so I am very concerned , '' Fauci told the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee during a hearing on the pandemic on Tuesday .\nFauci expressed dismay over people congregating in crowds and not wearing masks and inadequate attention being paid to guidelines on reopening .\n`` We 're going to continue to be in a lot of trouble , and there 's going to be a lot of hurt if that does not stop , '' he said .\nThe urgent message came during a hearing on the latest efforts by the US government to contain the pandemic , as several states struggle to contain the virus amid rising cases and state reopenings . The US reported more than 40,000 new Covid-19 cases on Friday , its biggest daily jump yet .\nAsked if the pandemic is under control , Fauci said , `` I am not satisfied with what 's going on because we are going in the wrong direction if you look at the curves of the new cases , so we 've really got to do something about that and we need to do it quickly , '' adding , `` Clearly we are not in total control right now . ''\nFauci said that he ca n't make an accurate prediction of the number of cases and deaths the US will see before the pandemic is over , but said , `` It 's going to be very disturbing , I will guarantee you that . ''\nFauci and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield stressed the importance of wearing masks during testimony before a Senate committee on Tuesday , with Fauci saying `` we recommend masks for everyone '' and `` masks are extremely important . ''\nRedfield singled out younger Americans in particular to deliver a message that they are not exempt from the necessity of wearing a mask .\n`` It is critical that we all take the personal responsibility to slow the transmission of Covid-19 and embrace the universal use of face coverings , '' he said . `` Specifically , I 'm addressing the younger members of our society , the Millennials and the Generation Zs -- I ask those that are listening to spread the word . ''\n`` We are all in this together , '' he said , adding , `` We recommend masks for everyone on the outside , anyone who comes into contact in a crowded area . You should avoid crowds where possible and when you 're outside and not have the capability of maintaining distance , you should wear a mask at all times . ''\nFauci indicated that he would support an effort to increase the production of high-quality masks in the US and distribute them free of charge to the American public in response to a question from Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders .\n`` Masks are extremely important , '' Fauci said , adding , `` There 's no doubt that wearing masks protects you and gets you to be protected . So it 's people protecting each other . Anything that furthers the use of masks , whether it 's giving out free masks or any other mechanism , I am thoroughly in favor of . ''\nMore than half of all states are seeing a rise in cases , and Florida , Texas and Arizona are getting hit particularly hard . Texas has begun scaling back its reopening , and beaches in Florida have closed for the upcoming holiday weekend .\nExperts testify on vaccine development as the FDA gets more involved\nDr. Stephen Hahn , commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration , said the FDA is taking action to help coronavirus vaccine developers get through the approval process faster .\n`` I am pleased to announce that today , FDA is taking action to aid the timely development of a safe and effective vaccine to prevent Covid-19 by providing guidance for developers , with recommendations on the data needed to facilitate manufacturing , clinical development , and approval , '' he said .\nHahn said the FDA is committed to `` help expedite this work , '' but added , `` We will not cut corners in our decision making . ''\nHahn said the guidance will `` provide regulatory clarity around what FDA expects with respect to those data . We want to see certain parts of those data so that we can demonstrate to the world , to the nation , to the American people , that we are following our rigorous standards with respect to safety and efficacy . ''\n`` This is particularly as important as we know that some people are skeptical of vaccine development efforts , '' he continued , adding that `` public confidence in vaccines is so important . ''\nSeparately , Redfield said there was `` substantial disappointment with American Airlines '' when the airline announced it would stop limiting seat sales on airlines .\n`` I can tell you that when they announced that the other day , obviously there was substantial disappointment with American Airlines , '' Redfield said . `` I can say this is under critical review right now by us at CDC . We do n't think it 's the right message . ''\nLast week , American Airlines said it plans to begin selling every seat on flights , something it has not done since the pandemic struck this spring .\nThe airline responded to criticism of the decision , saying in a statement Tuesday that it is committed to the `` safety and well-being of ( its ) customers and team members . '' The airline said that it has `` multiple layers of protection '' for passengers and that it provides flexibility to those who want to change flights .\nFauci and Redfield testified before lawmakers last week , when Fauci said `` we 're going to be doing more testing , not less , '' in response to President Donald Trump 's recent claim that he asked his administration to slow down testing during the pandemic .\nSenators have been weighing another stimulus package in recent weeks as unemployment numbers remain worrisome and economic hardship stemming from the pandemic persists .

And I'm very confident that we have all the testing we need to start opening the country in accordance with the safety guidelines that President Trump, the vice president, Dr. Birx, and Dr. Fauci laid out on April 19,\" he concluded.\n\nFox News' Brie Stimson contributed to this report.",

The UK has carried out 400 tests per million and Italy 1,000 as of 10 March . Health experts fear the virus may have spread undetected in US communities because few tests were carried out .\n`` We made a life-saving move with early action on China .

''\nPresident Trump has often cited travel restrictions as the reason the number of coronavirus cases is relatively low in the US and says many lives have been saved . On 31 January , any foreign national who had been to China within the previous 14 days was barred from entering the US . Three major US airlines operating flights to China had already stopped flying .\nLater in February , restrictions were placed on foreign nationals who had been in Iran - which was already under a travel ban - in the previous 14 days . Non-US citizens from 26 European countries were then banned from entering the US . Later , this was extended to include the UK and Ireland .\nUS citizens and their families are largely exempt from all these restrictions . Experts believe the US action bought the government time to prepare and reduced the number of cases , but we do n't know whether it saved lives . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has said travel restrictions can be harmful `` by hindering info-sharing , medical supply chains and harming economies '' .\nWhen asked about WHO data on the virus 's death rate : `` I think the 3.4 % is really a false number ... Personally , I think the number is way under 1 % . ''\nIn a telephone interview on Fox News , President Trump said a WHO figure of 3.4 % for the coronavirus death rate was `` false '' . WHO reported this figure on 3 March and said it was based on all the confirmed coronavirus cases that had resulted in death .\nMr Trump said he thought the true death rate , based on `` my hunch '' , was `` way under 1 % '' . He said the death rate appeared higher because many people who caught a mild form of the virus did not report it to the doctor and therefore did not end up as confirmed cases .\nAt the moment we do n't know how likely you are to die from coronavirus , mainly because of the lack of data on infections . However , scientists ' current best guess is about 1 % .\nOn 9 March : `` Last year 37,000 Americans died from the common flu . Nothing is shut down , life and the economy go on ... Think about that . ''\nThis statement from the president requires context . We do n't know exactly how many Americans ' deaths there have been linked to flu . But estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) give a range between 26,339 and 52,664 flu deaths last winter ( between October 2019 and February 2020 ) , with a best estimate of 34,157 . So a lot of people die from flu each year , as Mr Trump points out .\nHowever , unlike most strains of flu , the spread of new coronavirus has not yet been contained by vaccines or immunity from previous outbreaks , and scientists ( including those from the WHO ) believe it has a significantly higher death rate than that of seasonal flu ( which , on average , is about 0.1 % ) .\nOn 7 March : `` Very soon , we 're going to come up [ with a vaccine ] . ''\nCurrently there is no vaccine for this new coronavirus , although scientists in many countries are working hard to develop one .

        "content": "Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox . Sign up here .\nSen. Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , defended himself on Friday as MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked him `` why on earth '' he would tweet that journalists found `` glee '' in U.S. coronavirus cases outnumbering China 's .\n`` Some in our media can \u2019 t contain their glee & delight in reporting that the U.S. has more # CoronaVirus cases than # China , '' Rubio tweeted on Sunday . `` Beyond being grotesque , its bad journalism We have NO IDEA how many cases China really has but without any doubt its significantly more than why they admit to . '' The tweet received plenty of backlash but Rubio stood by his statement during his MSNBC interview .\nRuhle seemed incredulous when she asked Rubio about this tweet . \u201c I need to ask you this , because I \u2019 m a journalist . We \u2019 re not just some personalities . You called out journalism . And I need to understand why on earth you did this . \u201d\nBRET BAIER CALLS OUT CHINA , RUSSIA , NORTH KOREA OVER 'SUSPECT , ' 'SKEWED ' CORONAVIRUS STATS\nRubio replied : \u201c Well , because there are some journalists that were doing exactly what I said . ''\nRubio had tweeted out a series of posts showing journalists mocking the administration and America 's interest in being `` Number 1 . ''\nShe went on to suggest that Rubio was engaging in the same kind of finger-pointing that he condemned in others . Rubio responded by indicating that journalists were threatening national security by trusting Chinese figures .\n`` Yeah , but the difference is that this is an ongoing deal here , with what we 're dealing with right now , '' Rubio said , `` and that is a Chinese propaganda effort to put out that they have handled this perfectly and we have not -- and ... the national security and the national interest of the United States does not stop . ''\nHe added that people were `` taking the Chinese number of 80-something thousand infections and saying , 'look how great they did it and look how bad we 're doing it ' -- and that 's not only wrong , that 's a national security issue .

Marco Rubio, R-Fla., defended himself on Friday as MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked him \"why on earth\" he would tweet that journalists found \"glee\" in U.S. coronavirus cases outnumbering China's.\n\n\"Some in our media can\u2019t contain their glee & delight in reporting that the U.S. has more #CoronaVirus cases than #China,\" Rubio tweeted on Sunday. \"Beyond being grotesque, its bad journalism We have NO IDEA how many cases China really has but without any doubt its significantly more than why they admit to.\" The tweet received plenty of backlash but Rubio stood by his statement during his MSNBC interview.\n\nRuhle seemed incredulous when she asked Rubio about this tweet. \u201cI need to ask you this, because I\u2019m a journalist.

And I need to understand why on earth you did this.\u201d\n\nBRET BAIER CALLS OUT CHINA, RUSSIA, NORTH KOREA OVER 'SUSPECT,' 'SKEWED' CORONAVIRUS STATS\n\nRubio replied: \u201cWell, because there are some journalists that were doing exactly what I said.\"\n\nRubio had tweeted out a series of posts showing journalists mocking the administration and America's interest in being \"Number 1.\"\n\nShe went on to suggest that Rubio was engaging in the same kind of finger-pointing that he condemned in others. Rubio responded by indicating that journalists were threatening national security by trusting Chinese figures.\n\n\"Yeah, but the difference is that this is an ongoing deal here, with what we're dealing with right now,\" Rubio said, \"and that is a Chinese propaganda effort to put out that they have handled this perfectly and we have not -- and ... the national security and the national interest of the United States does not stop.\"\n\nHe added that people were \"taking the Chinese number of 80-something thousand infections and saying, 'look how great they did it and look how bad we're doing it' -- and that's not only wrong, that's a national security issue.

Sign up here .\nA class-action lawsuit filed in Florida this month seeks to `` make China pay for what they 've done '' in its handling of the coronavirus crisis , saying the country acted `` negligently in their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak . ''\nA personal injury law firm based in Boca Raton , Fla. , is bringing the suit against China and various Chinese government agencies on behalf of `` individuals and business owners in the United States and State of Florida , for damages suffered as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic . ''\nThe suit claims China `` knew that COVID-19 was dangerous and capable of causing a pandemic , yet slowly acted , proverbially put their head in the sand , and/or covered it up in their own economic self-interest . ''\n`` This is an undertaking against a world superpower who has the ability to pay for what they 've done , '' Jeremy Alters , the chief strategist and non-attorney spokesperson for the Berman Law Group , the class-action firm backing the suit , told Fox News .\n`` They have the money to pay for what they 've done , and we should all together make China pay for what they 've done , '' he said .\nWHITE HOUSE , SENATE STRIKE DEAL ON HISTORIC $ 2T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL , BUT HOUSE SUPPORT REMAINS UNCERTAIN\nThe original complaint has just a handful of named plaintiffs but the lawyers familiar with the case at Berman Law Group say they plan to file an amended complaint at some point with significantly more plaintiffs , including individuals who have gotten sick because of the coronavirus .\nThe lawsuit does not name a specific dollar amount being sought from China , asking for `` compensatory and other damages to Plaintiffs and the Class Members , for their economic and non-economic damages ... to the full extent permitted by the law . '' Alters , however , made clear that though lawyers for Berman would be seeking potentially `` tens of trillions '' from the communist nation , the suit was largely about the symbolism of forcing China to defend its actions in American courts .\n`` We want the court to make them pay for what they 've done , '' Alters said . `` They have unleashed ... a massive pandemic on the world . It appears they knew about it long before they gave information about it to the rest of the world . We want our courts to say , 'China , you are going to be held accountable here in our courts because you have harmed hundreds of millions of Americans . ' ''\nThe suit also has the potential , according to its backers , to bring to light documents and other information about the coronavirus that China may still be withholding from other governments and health experts worldwide .\nThis class-action suit is not the only one filed against China over the coronavirus , but it is the main serious complaint . The D.C.-based far-right organization Freedom Watch filed a $ 20 trillion suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas accusing the Chinese of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon \u2014 an allegation that has been debunked .\nThe Florida-based suit , however , seeks damages based on the Chinese government 's negligence in containing the coronavirus after it first was transmitted from animals to humans , an allegation with a large amount of supporting evidence .\nTHE CORONAVIRUS DID NOT ESCAPE FROM A LAB : HERE 'S HOW WE KNOW\nThis is made difficult , however , by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act ( FSIA ) which prevents Americans from suing other countries except under specific circumstances . The plaintiffs claim they fit under the exceptions for commercial activity and `` personal injury or death '' that stems from `` the tortious act or omission of that foreign state or of any official or employee of that foreign state while acting within the scope of his office or employment . ''\nYale law professor Stephen L. Carter , however , argued in a Bloomberg column Tuesday that the Florida suit 's claims do n't fall under the FSIA exceptions .\n`` The Florida class action suit asserts that the exception for commercial activities applies , but it \u2019 s not easy to see how , '' Carter writes .\nCarter also notes that the second exemption the Florida plaintiffs claim `` specifically bars any claim 'based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function regardless of whether the discretion be abused . ' It \u2019 s hard to find a way around this restriction . ''\nBut Alters says China 's negligence in its response to the coronavirus should fall under the exceptions to FSIA because of how egregious it is .\n`` There is a lengthy history of precedent for bringing foreign nations to our courts for their bad acts that affect Americans , '' he said Tuesday . `` I do n't know in history whether there has been another bad act like this that has affected this many Americans at once , where the entire economy is basically at a standstill and 14 states are now in a stay-at-home order . ''\nThe Florida suit against China also is important , according to its backers , because of the collaboration between two very different firms working the case .\nCORONAVIRUS HITTING NEW YORK LIKE A 'BULLET TRAIN ' AS CASES ARE 'DOUBLING ABOUT EVERY 3 DAYS ' , CUOMO WARNS\nBerman Law Group counts presidential candidate Joe Biden 's brother , Francis , as a senior adviser .

        "date": "",
        "authors": "",
        "content": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused President Donald Trump of `` spoiling for a fight '' , as the US leader lashed out at `` Democrat Governors '' .\nSeveral states , including New York , have begun cautious talks on reopening , but Mr Trump has claimed he has `` total '' power to lift virus lockdowns .\nMr Cuomo refuted the claim on Tuesday as Mr Trump took to Twitter to criticise the governor .\nThe US is the epicentre of the pandemic with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths .\nNew York state has the most cases , with almost 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths . However , it has seen signs of improvement , with the number of people hospitalised due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday .\nOn Monday , Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was `` the decision of the president '' , not state governors , although he added that he would make his decision `` in conjunction with governors '' .\nThe US Constitution says that states maintain public order and safety . So far , it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders .\nAlso on Monday , several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration .\nTen states - seven on the East Coast , led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo , and three on the West Coast , led by California Governor Gavin Newsom , said they would co-ordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained . All but one of the states is led by a Democratic governor .\nNow , a row has erupted over who has the ultimate authority to lift lockdown orders .\nOn Monday night , Mr Trump gave a combative press conference where he feuded with reporters , criticised their coverage of how he handled the outbreak , and said that when it came to reopening the economy , `` the president of the United States calls the shots '' .\n`` When somebody is the president of the United States , the authority is total , '' he said , adding : `` They ca n't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States .

However, it has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalised due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday.\n\nWhat's the row about?\n\nOn Monday, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was \"the decision of the president\", not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision \"in conjunction with governors\".\n\nThe US Constitution says that states maintain public order and safety. So far, it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders.\n\nAlso on Monday, several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration.\n\nTen states - seven on the East Coast, led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and three on the West Coast, led by California Governor Gavin Newsom, said they would co-ordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained. All but one of the states is led by a Democratic governor.\n\nNow, a row has erupted over who has the ultimate authority to lift lockdown orders.\n\nWho said what?\n\nOn Monday night, Mr Trump gave a combative press conference where he feuded with reporters, criticised their coverage of how he handled the outbreak, and said that when it came to reopening the economy, \"the president of the United States calls the shots\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Reporter challenges President Trump at briefing\n\n\"When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,\" he said, adding: \"They can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States.\"\n\nHis position has been contradicted by governors and legal experts. It also contrasts with his earlier position that the responsibility for fighting the outbreak and order lockdowns lies primarily with state governors.\n\nThe row continued on Tuesday, as Mr Cuomo told CBS Mr Trump did not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses, because \"we don't have a king, we have a president\".\n\nDuring his daily press briefing, Mr Cuomo criticised Mr Trump, adding he would \"not engage\" in a fight with him, but would have \"no choice\" if the president the threatened the welfare of New Yorkers.\n\nHe added: \"I put my hand out in total partnership and co-operation with the president.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump took the row to Twitter on Tuesday, criticising Mr Cuomo and issuing an oblique snipe at other governors.\n\n\"Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty\" was one of my all time favourite movies,\" Mr Trump, a Republican, wrote.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"Dear Class of 2020\": Graduating high school seniors' messages to their peers\n\n\"A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain.\" The tale tells of a ship's revolt in which mutineers meet with unhappy ends, with Mr Trump appearing to compare himself to the captain.\n\nThe president aimed particular fire at Mr Cuomo, who he said was calling \"daily, even hourly, begging for everything,\" like hospitals, beds, ventilators for his state.

        "title": "Coronavirus: What's behind alarming new US outbreaks?",
        "date": "",
        "authors": "",
        "content": "As coronavirus outbreaks are slowly brought to heel in many places around the world , the US is among a handful of countries facing a surge of new infections .\nMore than two dozen states are now seeing increases in new cases over the last 14 days .\nOf these , Texas , Florida , Arizona and California have emerged as the country 's latest virus epicentres .\nBut while cases are clearly rising , state leaders and health experts are divided on the cause .\nHere 's a look at these four US hotspots , the facts and figures raising alarm , and the theories that may help explain each surge .\nFirst , it 's important to note that across the US , more efficient testing has played some role in the climbing case count . The number of Covid-19 tests being administered now is nearly double what it was in April and May .\nBut the positive test rate tells us that testing ca n't explain away the rise .\nIf lots of tests are being conducted and the spread of the coronavirus has been reduced , then the positive case rate would fall in tandem . The World Health Organization says that states should have a positive case rate at or below 5 % for two weeks before they loosen restrictions on movement .\nEven with testing success stories , it 's clear that the southern and western US are seeing a particularly sharp spike in infections and their rate .\nAs of 30 June , Texas , Florida , Arizona or California all fall under that category - and all fail to meet the bar .\nAfter nearly three months of new cases hovering between 1,000 and 2,000 each day - Texas ' infection count has spiked in the last two weeks , with up to 6,000 new illnesses reported in a single day .\nThe sharp rise in cases has been mirrored by record highs in hospital admissions - reaching at 5,913 on Monday - and stoking fears that the state 's hospitals will soon be overwhelmed .\nIf this trajectory persists , Houston , the state 's most populous city , `` would become the worst affected city in the US '' , possibly rivalling what 's happening now in Brazil , wrote Peter Hotez , director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children 's Hospital , on Twitter . `` I can not really see how things get better on their own . ''\nWhy the rise ? Many point to the south-western state 's leading role peeling back lockdown measures .\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott allowed his stay home order to expire on 30 April , with almost all businesses - including bars and restaurants - operating to at least 50 % capacity by early June . Last week , amid the surge , the governor shut down all bars and ordered restaurants to cut down capacity from 75 to 50 % .\n`` If I could go back and redo anything , it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars , '' Mr Abbott said to El Paso station KVIA-TV . A `` bar setting , in reality , just does n't work with a pandemic '' .\nPacked restaurants and bars may also fit with another national trend : the average age of people diagnosed with Covid-19 has decreased gradually throughout the pandemic .\nIn certain counties , people under the age 30 make up the majority of Covid patients , Mr Abbott said at a press conference earlier this month , which `` typically results from people going to the bar-type settings '' .\nParts of the state are now also enacting rules on face coverings .\nPolicies on masks are one of the factors differentiating states like Texas from those seeing lower transmission rates .\nIn 11 states with mask rules in place - including New York and Illinois - the number of new cases has declined 25 % in the last two weeks , according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer . On the other hand , in states where only some employees have to wear masks , new cases have risen by an average of 70 % .\nFlorida 's stay home order expired shortly after Texas ' , on 4 May .\nWhile the state 's most populous counties , Miami-Dade and Broward , held off until 18 May , Florida still had one of the more aggressive reopening strategies in the US .\nDisney properties and beaches began reopening by the end of last month , just as Americans across the country celebrated the Memorial Day holiday . Days into June , bars , restaurants , gyms , and shops were also resuming business .\nNow , the Sunshine State is seeing a surge in Covid-19 - this past weekend saw over 8,500 new cases per day . In the last two weeks , cases have increased fivefold , according to the New York Times .\nHospitalisations are up as well , but Florida 's death toll has not seen so sharp a rise thus far .\nThe governor 's answer for why that may be lines up with what the White House has said : more testing and more young people with infections .\nRepublican Governor Ron DeSantis said a backlog `` test dump '' coupled with transmission in the 18 to 35 age range is behind the concerning counts .

        "content_original": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Younger Americans have been blamed for the rise in a number of states, including Florida\n\nAs coronavirus outbreaks are slowly brought to heel in many places around the world, the US is among a handful of countries facing a surge of new infections.\n\nMore than two dozen states are now seeing increases in new cases over the last 14 days.\n\nOf these, Texas, Florida, Arizona and California have emerged as the country's latest virus epicentres.\n\nBut while cases are clearly rising, state leaders and health experts are divided on the cause.\n\nHere's a look at these four US hotspots, the facts and figures raising alarm, and the theories that may help explain each surge.\n\nWhat about testing?\n\nFirst, it's important to note that across the US, more efficient testing has played some role in the climbing case count. The number of Covid-19 tests being administered now is nearly double what it was in April and May.\n\nBut the positive test rate tells us that testing can't explain away the rise.\n\nIf lots of tests are being conducted and the spread of the coronavirus has been reduced, then the positive case rate would fall in tandem. The World Health Organization says that states should have a positive case rate at or below 5% for two weeks before they loosen restrictions on movement.\n\nEven with testing success stories, it's clear that the southern and western US are seeing a particularly sharp spike in infections and their rate.\n\nAs of 30 June, Texas, Florida, Arizona or California all fall under that category - and all fail to meet the bar.\n\nTexas\n\nAfter nearly three months of new cases hovering between 1,000 and 2,000 each day - Texas' infection count has spiked in the last two weeks, with up to 6,000 new illnesses reported in a single day.\n\nThe sharp rise in cases has been mirrored by record highs in hospital admissions - reaching at 5,913 on Monday - and stoking fears that the state's hospitals will soon be overwhelmed.\n\nIf this trajectory persists, Houston, the state's most populous city, \"would become the worst affected city in the US\", possibly rivalling what's happening now in Brazil, wrote Peter Hotez, director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital, on Twitter. \"I cannot really see how things get better on their own.\"\n\nWhy the rise? Many point to the south-western state's leading role peeling back lockdown measures.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott allowed his stay home order to expire on 30 April, with almost all businesses - including bars and restaurants - operating to at least 50% capacity by early June. Last week, amid the surge, the governor shut down all bars and ordered restaurants to cut down capacity from 75 to 50%.\n\n\"If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars,\" Mr Abbott said to El Paso station KVIA-TV. A \"bar setting, in reality, just doesn't work with a pandemic\".\n\nPacked restaurants and bars may also fit with another national trend: the average age of people diagnosed with Covid-19 has decreased gradually throughout the pandemic.\n\nIn certain counties, people under the age 30 make up the majority of Covid patients, Mr Abbott said at a press conference earlier this month, which \"typically results from people going to the bar-type settings\".\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nParts of the state are now also enacting rules on face coverings.\n\nPolicies on masks are one of the factors differentiating states like Texas from those seeing lower transmission rates.\n\nIn 11 states with mask rules in place - including New York and Illinois - the number of new cases has declined 25% in the last two weeks, according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer. On the other hand, in states where only some employees have to wear masks, new cases have risen by an average of 70%.\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida's stay home order expired shortly after Texas', on 4 May.\n\nWhile the state's most populous counties, Miami-Dade and Broward, held off until 18 May, Florida still had one of the more aggressive reopening strategies in the US.\n\nDisney properties and beaches began reopening by the end of last month, just as Americans across the country celebrated the Memorial Day holiday. Days into June, bars, restaurants, gyms, and shops were also resuming business.\n\nNow, the Sunshine State is seeing a surge in Covid-19 - this past weekend saw over 8,500 new cases per day. In the last two weeks, cases have increased fivefold, according to the New York Times.\n\nHospitalisations are up as well, but Florida's death toll has not seen so sharp a rise thus far.\n\nThe governor's answer for why that may be lines up with what the White House has said: more testing and more young people with infections.\n\nRepublican Governor Ron DeSantis said a backlog \"test dump\" coupled with transmission in the 18 to 35 age range is behind the concerning counts. He said that 20% of Floridians aged 25 to 34 are testing positive, and called on younger residents to be more careful, citing graduation parties that ignored social distancing rules.\n\n\"We've been stressing avoiding the three Cs, which are: closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with many people nearby and close-contact settings, such as close-range conversations,\" Mr DeSantis said.\n\nBut some experts say even with testing, the numbers still point to community spread linked to more social contact.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Florida businesses have been checking visitors' temperature as they enter\n\nFormer CDC Director Tom Frieden told Fox News on Sunday: \"As a doctor, a scientist, an epidemiologist, I can tell you with 100% certainty that in most states where you're seeing an increase, it is a real increase. It is not more tests; it is more spread of the virus.\"\n\nMr DeSantis has stopped short of enacting any mandatory measures to curb Covid-19 transmission - however, mayors in South Florida, the hardest-hit region of the state, have been discussing next steps.\n\nIn Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, beaches will be closed for the Fourth of July Independence Day weekend. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez will also be limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people, with masks required.\n\nArizona\n\nArizona may be the region with the most concerning surge in America. In mid-June, a Harvard epidemiologist noted the state had a higher case count and percent positivity rate than Brazil and Peru at the time.\n\nIt's a familiar story here too: the south-western state's spike follows its reopening timeline.\n\nRepublican Governor Doug Ducey lifted Arizona's stay-at-home order on 15 May. In the time since, dine-in restaurants, bars, casinos, gyms, golf clubs and swimming pools reopened. There were health recommendations but no mandate on face coverings or enforcement of social distancing.\n\nAs of 30 June, cases have been increasing by 85% in a 14-day period, according to the Covid Exit Strategy tracker.

However , he has not given further details , and there has not been routine testing for the virus in the US .\nIn an interview with CNN on Thursday , Vice-President Mike Pence could not confirm how many Americans had been tested for the virus , saying he `` would leave that to the experts '' .\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , a total of at least 11,079 specimens have been tested since January . However , the number of people tested is likely to be lower , as patients typically provide at least two specimens for testing .\nFurthermore , government officials say they do not know the number of people being tested , because some tests are being conducted by private hospitals and laboratories that have not been reporting in to the CDC .\nThe Atlantic , which is running a project to track the number of tests being conducted , estimates about 8,000 people have been tested . Meanwhile , lawmakers who went to a briefing with health officials told Politico that fewer than 10,000 Americans had been tested .\nBy contrast , South Korea has tested more than 210,000 people and is testing nearly 20,000 people every day , while in the UK , more than 29,700 people have been tested , and more than 1,000 tests are being carried out per day .\nIn neighbouring Canada , there are currently about 100 confirmed cases .

''\n`` The truth is ... we 've underinvested in the public health labs . ''\nOn Wednesday , President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions on 26 European countries - but was criticised by Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer for not addressing the lack of sufficient coronavirus testing kits .\nRepublican lawmakers have also expressed frustration , with one senator , James Lankford saying : `` We 've got a long way to go to be able to get rapid , efficient testing . ''\nMr Lankford added that it was `` not accurate '' when President Trump said everyone in the US who wanted to get tested could get one .\nMeanwhile , Senator Mitt Romney said it was `` very frustrating '' that the testing had been slow .\n`` You ca n't get wipes for your countertop . You ca n't get alcohol ... and it 's very difficult to get tests .

''\nHospital workers and patients were exposed to the virus as a result , he said .\nAnother doctor at the hospital , who asked to remain anonymous , said that failing to prepare was `` foolish '' and may have exacerbated the spread .\nInitially , the hospital said that broader training was not needed , arguing that having only a small group of doctors working with coronavirus patients would limit exposure .\nHospitals in Seattle have since updated their procedures , but Dr Adami feared the same mistakes could be repeated elsewhere in the US .\n`` I want other hospitals in the US to look at this and say , 'what can we do better ?

You can't get alcohol... and it's very difficult to get tests.\"\n\nWhat is happening elsewhere?\n\nIn other developments:\n\n'We weren't prepared for this'\n\nAshitha Nagesh, BBC News\n\nBy the time the coronavirus hit Seattle and turned the city into the centre of the US outbreak, it had already spread rapidly in countries like Italy and Iran.\n\nDespite this, Seattle doctors told me, their hospital wasn't ready for what was coming.\n\nDr Alex Adami of University of Washington Medical said: \"None of us were actually trained in how to deal with the precautions for this disease, or what to do in terms of screening or providing care for these patients.\"\n\nHospital workers and patients were exposed to the virus as a result, he said.\n\nAnother doctor at the hospital, who asked to remain anonymous, said that failing to prepare was \"foolish\" and may have exacerbated the spread.\n\nInitially, the hospital said that broader training was not needed, arguing that having only a small group of doctors working with coronavirus patients would limit exposure.\n\nHospitals in Seattle have since updated their procedures, but Dr Adami feared the same mistakes could be repeated elsewhere in the US.\n\n\"I want other hospitals in the US to look at this and say, 'what can we do better?'. I want people to look at this and learn the lesson that you have to be proactive and not reactive.\"",

        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Over the weekend , Republican Sen. Tom Cotton came under fire for a series of comments and tweets on the coronavirus . On Fox News Sunday morning , Cotton suggested the virus did not originate in an animal market as the Chinese government has claimed , but perhaps from another source , such as an infectious disease research lab nearby . While acknowledging there 's no evidence the disease originated there , Cotton questioned the validity of China 's statements , saying `` China was lying from the beginning , and they 're still lying today . ''\nCotton 's theory is one of many that have been floating around as China and other countries aim to get a handle on the outbreak . Here 's what we know about the coronavirus .\nAfter his appearance on Fox News , Cotton took to Twitter to clarify his position . He claimed there are `` at least four hypotheses about the origin of the virus , '' ranging from `` the engineered-bio weapon hypothesis `` to `` natural , '' which Cotton calls `` still the most likely but almost certainly not from the Wuhan food market . ''\nIn his interview on Fox , Cotton said his conviction that the virus did not originate in the Wuhan food market was based on a study published in the Lancet medical journal in January 2020 .\n`` Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China who have published a study in the international journal The Lancet have demonstrated that several of the original cases did not have any contact with that food market , '' Cotton said . `` The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market . ''\nEarly January statements from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission had said most cases were related to the South China Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan , based on preliminary studies .\nBesides Cotton , The Washington Times , citing an Israeli biological warfare analyst , suggested the virus was developed in a lab , potentially as part of a Chinese bioweapons program . A story claiming China planned to admit the virus came from the lab was also circulating on Facebook but flagged by fact-checkers as false .\nFacts First : Experts have dismissed Cotton 's `` engineered bioweapon hypothesis '' but noted it 's possible , yet unlikely , that the lab was connected to the start of the outbreak .\nVipin Narang , an associate professor of political science at MIT with a background in chemical engineering told CNN , `` the thing that weighs against the claim is that it 's a terrible bioweapon . If you were engineering a bioweapon this would have the absolute opposite of the characteristics you would want . ''\n`` If the claim is that there were bats at the facility that may have had the novel coronavirus and there was a lapse in security and protocol , it 's possible but it does n't sound like there was anything intentional , '' Narang said . `` Unless there 's strong evidence to the contrary that should be the operating assumption . ''\nRegarding Cotton 's hypothesis that the virus originated in connection with a lab , Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center , said `` I have seen no one provide any solid information to support that theory . I think at this point you can draw a line through it and say that did n't happen . ''\n`` Everyone with whom I 've spoken , or whom I 've read , thinks that it has come from a natural source , as did the SARS virus , as did the MERS virus . Both of those were also coronaviruses in animal populations that jumped to the human species in the natural environment , '' Schaffner said . `` By now scientists all over the world have looked at this virus and nothing nefarious has come up . ''\nIn his conversation with Fox 's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday , Cotton decried China 's response to the virus . He said , `` They have more than 70 million people now under quarantine , and you 've probably seen the videos online from social media sites , as have I , of the Chinese Communist Party 's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you . ''\nFacts First : Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China 's response to the situation . While almost half of China 's population is in some way Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China 's response to the situation . While almost half of China 's population is in some way restricted from traveling in response to the outbreak , not all of these individuals are in quarantine .\nThe strictest restrictions are in the four cities at the heart of the outbreak , where residents are now forbidden to leave their homes . The combined population of these cities is approximately 25 million .\nEven taking into account individuals outside of these cities in self-quarantine as well as the more than 70,000 individuals in mainland China infected with the virus , the total is still less than Cotton 's estimated 70 million . As of Monday , the total number of cases of coronavirus worldwide was 71,000 which includes patients demonstrating symptoms who have not yet tested positive . While there have been concerns about the figures China has reported , given the government 's track record of suppressing information about this and previous crises , the World Health Organization has backed the way China now counts and reports the number of coronavirus cases .\nIn an effort to stop the spread of the virus , certain residential compounds have been sealed off and officials have been authorized to go door-to-door for screening purposes .\nOn these screenings Schaffner said , `` We know that people have been organized to go door to door and take their temperature and seek out people who are ill . I have heard reports that sometimes they are forceful , but I have not heard about beating . ''\nPresident Donald Trump has also been vocal on Twitter about the coronavirus , largely in praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping 's response to the situation . In one such series of tweets , Trump implied warm weather would weaken and help eliminate the virus , a claim he has since reiterated in public remarks .\nSpeaking to the nation 's governors , Trump said , `` The virus that we 're talking about having to do , you know a lot of people think that goes away in April , with the heat , as the heat comes in . Typically that will go away in April . ''\nFacts First : Infectious disease experts told CNN nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior , so they can not say for sure yet whether it will behave as the President has claimed .\nThere is a basis for the President 's assumption . During a briefing last week on the coronavirus , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that the regular flu is seasonal , with a decline in cases often around March and April .\n`` There 's a certainty , for example , of seasonal flu , '' Fauci said . `` The issue now with this is that there 's a lot of unknowns .

I think at this point you can draw a line through it and say that didn't happen.\"\n\n\"Everyone with whom I've spoken, or whom I've read, thinks that it has come from a natural source, as did the SARS virus, as did the MERS virus. Both of those were also coronaviruses in animal populations that jumped to the human species in the natural environment,\" Schaffner said. \"By now scientists all over the world have looked at this virus and nothing nefarious has come up.\"\n\nChinese response\n\nIn his conversation with Fox's Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, Cotton decried China's response to the virus. He said, \"They have more than 70 million people now under quarantine, and you've probably seen the videos online from social media sites, as have I, of the Chinese Communist Party's police beating people who they think might have coronavirus or trying to keep them locked inside of their apartments or quarantining them in large hospitals or what have you.\"\n\nFacts First: Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China's response to the situation. While almost half of China's population is in some way Cotton exaggerated certain aspects of China's response to the situation. While almost half of China's population is in some way restricted from traveling in response to the outbreak, not all of these individuals are in quarantine.\n\nThe strictest restrictions are in the four cities at the heart of the outbreak, where residents are now forbidden to leave their homes. The combined population of these cities is approximately 25 million.\n\nEven taking into account individuals outside of these cities in self-quarantine as well as the more than 70,000 individuals in mainland China infected with the virus, the total is still less than Cotton's estimated 70 million. As of Monday, the total number of cases of coronavirus worldwide was 71,000 which includes patients demonstrating symptoms who have not yet tested positive. While there have been concerns about the figures China has reported, given the government's track record of suppressing information about this and previous crises, the World Health Organization has backed the way China now counts and reports the number of coronavirus cases.\n\nIn an effort to stop the spread of the virus, certain residential compounds have been sealed off and officials have been authorized to go door-to-door for screening purposes.\n\nOn these screenings Schaffner said, \"We know that people have been organized to go door to door and take their temperature and seek out people who are ill. I have heard reports that sometimes they are forceful, but I have not heard about beating.\"\n\nWarm weather to the rescue?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also been vocal on Twitter about the coronavirus, largely in praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping's response to the situation. In one such series of tweets, Trump implied warm weather would weaken and help eliminate the virus, a claim he has since reiterated in public remarks.\n\nSpeaking to the nation's governors, Trump said , \"The virus that we're talking about having to do, you know a lot of people think that goes away in April, with the heat, as the heat comes in. Typically that will go away in April.\"\n\nFacts First: Infectious disease experts told CNN nobody knows enough about the novel coronavirus to make assessments about its behavior, so they cannot say for sure yet whether it will behave as the President has claimed.\n\nThere is a basis for the President's assumption. During a briefing last week on the coronavirus, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases noted that the regular flu is seasonal, with a decline in cases often around March and April.\n\n\"There's a certainty, for example, of seasonal flu,\" Fauci said. \"The issue now with this is that there's a lot of unknowns.\"",

There were single-use paper menus . Arrows told patrons which way to go in . Everyone needed a mask -- and if you did n't have one , the restaurant would give you one .\nThese are the new rules , put in place by Connecticut officials as the state joined others across the US in beginning its gradual reopening .\nPeople still are n't allowed to dine inside , but this first little freedom made some locals happy .\nOne man told CNN he felt this was long overdue .\n`` I understand the caution and everybody wants to be safe but sometimes some things are being taken to the extreme , '' he told CNN 's Brynn Gingras . `` And they just have to understand people ( who are ) trapped inside , they ca n't take it anymore . They 've got to get back out . ''\nNow , as states start to roll back restrictions put in place during stay-at-home orders , the question remains : When will people feel safe to go out , and what are the risks ?\nWith only a handful of states showing significant improvement in infection rates , some experts caution it could be too soon .\nAs of Wednesday afternoon , at least 18 states had registered an upward trend in average daily cases -- a rise of at least 10 % -- over the previous seven days , according to an analysis of Johns Hopkins University data .\nOnly 17 states ' average daily cases dropped more than 10 % , while the rest were level or near level , the data showed .\nMore than 1.55 million people in the United States have tested positive for the virus and at least 93,406 have died , according to Johns Hopkins University .\n`` The only thing that was keeping this very contagious virus in check was each of us keeping that physical distance , '' former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen said Tuesday . `` If we 're going to let people go to work and reopen , we are going to be introducing risk of some kind . The key is what are the steps we can take to reduce that risk as much as possible ? ''\nStates have moved at different paces as governors balance reopening their economies with keeping residents safe . Some states , including Georgia and Texas , rolled out aggressive reopening plans , while others have taken a more measured approach .\nAlaska 's and Iowa 's governors said their states are ready to reopen most businesses Friday .\nIn Alaska , that means all businesses , houses of worship , libraries , museums and sporting activities can resume at 8 a.m. , Gov . Mike Dunleavy 's office said . Alaska has the fewest cases of all 50 states , has reported only single-digit new cases since mid-April and boasted no new cases Monday .\nAlaskans are still encouraged to take precautions , such as distancing and wearing masks in crowds , and visitation will remain limited to prisons and senior centers , the governor 's office said .\nIowa Gov . Kim Reynolds intends to allow movie theaters , zoos , aquariums , museums and wedding venues reopen Friday , she said . Swimming pools will be allowed to open for laps and lessons as well .

There were single-use paper menus. Arrows told patrons which way to go in. Everyone needed a mask -- and if you didn't have one, the restaurant would give you one.\n\nThese are the new rules, put in place by Connecticut officials as the state joined others across the US in beginning its gradual reopening.\n\nPeople still aren't allowed to dine inside, but this first little freedom made some locals happy.\n\nOne man told CNN he felt this was long overdue.\n\n\"I understand the caution and everybody wants to be safe but sometimes some things are being taken to the extreme,\" he told CNN's Brynn Gingras. \"And they just have to understand people (who are) trapped inside, they can't take it anymore. They've got to get back out.\"\n\nNow, as states start to roll back restrictions put in place during stay-at-home orders, the question remains: When will people feel safe to go out, and what are the risks?\n\nWith only a handful of states showing significant improvement in infection rates, some experts caution it could be too soon.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, at least 18 states had registered an upward trend in average daily cases -- a rise of at least 10% -- over the previous seven days, according to an analysis of Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nOnly 17 states' average daily cases dropped more than 10%, while the rest were level or near level, the data showed.\n\nMore than 1.55 million people in the United States have tested positive for the virus and at least 93,406 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\n\"The only thing that was keeping this very contagious virus in check was each of us keeping that physical distance,\" former Baltimore Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen said Tuesday. \"If we're going to let people go to work and reopen, we are going to be introducing risk of some kind. The key is what are the steps we can take to reduce that risk as much as possible?\"\n\nDifferent strokes for different states\n\nStates have moved at different paces as governors balance reopening their economies with keeping residents safe. Some states, including Georgia and Texas, rolled out aggressive reopening plans, while others have taken a more measured approach.\n\nAlaska's and Iowa's governors said their states are ready to reopen most businesses Friday.\n\nIn Alaska, that means all businesses, houses of worship, libraries, museums and sporting activities can resume at 8 a.m., Gov. Mike Dunleavy's office said. Alaska has the fewest cases of all 50 states, has reported only single-digit new cases since mid-April and boasted no new cases Monday.\n\nAlaskans are still encouraged to take precautions, such as distancing and wearing masks in crowds, and visitation will remain limited to prisons and senior centers, the governor's office said.\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds intends to allow movie theaters, zoos, aquariums, museums and wedding venues reopen Friday, she said. Swimming pools will be allowed to open for laps and lessons as well. Bars can reopen May 28, and school-sponsored activities, such as sports, can resume June 1, she said.\n\nIowa tallied 212 new cases Tuesday, marking its third straight day of declining Covid-19 positives, according to state data. Its total cases have been on the decline for a week, the data shows.\n\nIndiana, too, plans to move ahead with opening a large swath of its economy Friday, but with numerous restrictions, including: limiting social gatherings to 100 people, limiting dining rooms to 50% capacity and stores to 75% capacity, and omitting contact games, such as football and lacrosse, from the list of sports allowed to resume.\n\n\"We're still telling you to be overly cautious about surrounding yourself in an environment that could put you at risk,\" Gov.

Sign up here .\nPresident Trump on Friday signed a more than $ 2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak \u2019 s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day .\n`` I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first , '' Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony .\nTrump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation : `` I 've never signed anything with a 'T ' on it , '' Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending .\nThe legislation , approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker \u2019 s objections , amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history . It includes checks for most Americans , boosted unemployment aid , help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations \u2013 at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace , a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines .\n\u201c This bill is not only a rescue package , it is a commitment ... that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face , both now and in the foreseeable future , \u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , said prior to the vote . `` To the American public : If you do your part , I promise we will do ours . ''\nThe approval , while widely anticipated , followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote .\nRep. Thomas Massie , R-Ky. , had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel . Massie , as part of his push , wanted to ensure there is a quorum , which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill .\nSo as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding , hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York , California and elsewhere . This , despite strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers .\n\u201c Massie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill , '' said Rep. Peter King , R-N.Y. , who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday .\nWhile Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote , he was not , in the end , able to force a roll-call .\nThe House , after several hours of debate , ultimately passed the measure by voice vote , and it was allowed to stand .\nThere were loud cries for \u2018 ayes \u2019 and few rumblings of \u2018 nos \u2019 on the House floor .\n\u201c The ayes have it , \u201d declared the presiding officer , Rep. Anthony Brown , D-Md .\nBut Massie stood up and objected . \u201c I came here to make sure our republic doesn \u2019 t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote , \u201d Massie said .\nBrown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote . But Massie pressed on .\n\u201c I object on the basis that a quorum is not present , \u201d Massie said , instructing a count of lawmakers .\n\u201c A quorum is present and the motion is adopted , \u201d Brown ruled , to applause .\nMinutes before the vote , Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort .\nPelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses , while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers . She paid homage to a nurse manager , Kious Kelly , who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns .\n\u201c We know that this can not be our final bill , \u201d Pelosi said .\nIn a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill , lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill 's imperfections .\n\u201c We 're going to help Americans through this , '' McCarthy said . `` We 're going to do this together and in the end , we are going to be healthier , stronger and more united than ever before , because as Americans , that 's who we are . \u201d\nUpon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote , though , Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations .\n`` It \u2019 s pretty clear now , with enough members here to pass the bill , that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY . Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind , and no recorded vote ? # SWAMP , '' he tweeted .\nAfter the voice vote , Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications .\n`` There 's a big cover up in there , '' Massie said as he exited the Capitol .\nEmotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $ 2 trillion stimulus bill .\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. , started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen \u2019 s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don \u2019 t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment .\nShe ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get \u201c crumbs . \u201d\n\u201c What did the Senate majority fight for ? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history . Shameful ! \u201d Ocasio-Cortez said .\nOn the other side of the aisle , Rep. Scott Perry , R-Pa. , said he \u2019 s \u201c distressed by the Hobson \u2019 s choice '' lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief .\n\u201c No more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated . No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention , \u201d Perry said .\nIn a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama , Rep. Haley Stevens , D-Mich. , refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor , even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time .\nInstead , Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands \u2013 clad with pink surgical gloves\u2014in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut .\nAs the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens \u201c out of order , \u201d Stevens screamed , \u201c do not be afraid ! \u201d\nRepublicans , who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep \u2019 s seat in November , immediately pounced on the outburst as a \u201c meltdown . \u201d\nThe bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $ 4 trillion-plus annual federal budget . The $ 2.2 trillion estimate is the White House 's best guess of the spending it contains .\nThe legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $ 1,200 per adult making up to $ 75,000 a year and $ 2,400 to a married couple making up to $ 150,000 , with $ 500 payments per child .\nUnemployment insurance would be made far more generous , with $ 600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July . States and local governments would receive $ 150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis .\nThe legislation also establishes a $ 454 billion program for guaranteed , subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $ 4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses , states , and municipalities . All would be up to the Treasury Department 's discretion , though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible .\nThere was also $ 150 billion devoted to the health care system , including $ 100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads .\nFrustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie , R-Ky. , threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible .\n\u201c To you who oppose this bill : Please , please stand down , '' Rep. Fred Upton , R-Mich. , pleaded on the House floor . `` We ca n't wait another day to help . Do n't add to this disruption by , in fact , being a disruptor . Be a leader . ''\nLawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses . Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful , while it \u2019 s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with .\n\u201c This is ripping my heart out because there \u2019 s things in this bill that just don \u2019 t belong there . I consider them -- , '' Rep. David Schweikert , R-Ariz. , said , stopping himself midsentence . \u201c Well , I can \u2019 t say that word in front of a microphone . \u201d\nSchweikert , however , argued Congress must \u201c do the right thing \u201d by passing the legislation .\nHowever , Rep. Ken Buck , R-Colo. , said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns .\n`` As President Trump said , we can not let the cure be worse than the problem itself , '' Buck said .",

Peter King, R-N.Y., who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday.\n\nWhile Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call.\n\nThe House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand.\n\nThere were loud cries for \u2018ayes\u2019 and few rumblings of \u2018nos\u2019 on the House floor.\n\n\u201cThe ayes have it,\u201d declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md.\n\nBut Massie stood up and objected. \u201cI came here to make sure our republic doesn\u2019t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,\u201d Massie said.\n\nBrown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on.\n\n\u201cI object on the basis that a quorum is not present,\u201d Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers.\n\n\u201cA quorum is present and the motion is adopted,\u201d Brown ruled, to applause.\n\nMinutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort.\n\nPelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious Kelly, who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns.\n\n\u201cWe know that this cannot be our final bill,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nIn a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections.\n\n\u201cWe're going to help Americans through this,\" McCarthy said. \"We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.\u201d\n\nUpon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,\" he tweeted.\n\nAfter the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications.\n\n\"There's a big cover up in there,\" Massie said as he exited the Capitol.\n\nEmotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don\u2019t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment.\n\nShe ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to the income inequality gap in order for families to get \u201ccrumbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he\u2019s \u201cdistressed by the Hobson\u2019s choice\" lawmakers face of having to accept unrelated spending sprees in order to send relief.\n\n\u201cNo more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,\u201d Perry said.\n\nIn a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time.\n\nInstead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands \u2013 clad with pink surgical gloves\u2014in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut.\n\nAs the presiding officer was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens \u201cout of order,\u201d Stevens screamed, \u201cdo not be afraid!\u201d\n\nRepublicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep\u2019s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\nThe bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains.\n\nThe legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.\n\nUnemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis.\n\nThe legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible.\n\nThere was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.\n\nFrustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible.\n\n\u201cTo you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,\" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor. \"We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader.\"\n\nLawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it\u2019s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with.\n\n\u201cThis is ripping my heart out because there\u2019s things in this bill that just don\u2019t belong there. I consider them--,\" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping himself midsentence. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say that word in front of a microphone.\u201d\n\nSchweikert, however, argued Congress must \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by passing the legislation.\n\nHowever, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns.\n\n\"As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,\" Buck said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "content_original": "(CNN) More than 97% of the US population is currently under a stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order as the coronavirus pandemic continues to upend life as we know it. But worries for the economy -- and people's mental health -- are raising the question: When will things go back to normal?\n\nPresident Donald Trump has indicated many states can reopen by May 1, and on Thursday shared federal guidelines for restarting the economy with governors.\n\nAcross the country, governors have been forming pacts . Those leaders are highlighting the importance of using science and advice from health officials rather than politics to choose when to reopen the economy. Expanded testing, tracking contacts of people who had the virus, improved treatment options and vaccine development are important, they say.\n\nHere's the latest on where states stand in their plan to reopen:\n\nAlabama\n\nGov. Kay Ivey issued a stay-at-home order set to expire on April 30.\n\nLt. Gov. Will Ainsworth announced the formation of a task force to reopen the state's economy. It is scheduled to report its suggestions to the governor on April 22.\n\nIvey said April 14 she intends to work with other states and the Trump administration, but that \"what works in Alabama works in Alabama.\"\n\nWhen the economy starts to reopen, Ivey said during a press briefing it will be a slow process over time, \"segment by segment or region by region.\"\n\nAlaska\n\nGov. Mike Dunleavy has ordered residents to stay at home until April 21.\n\nDunleavy has said that Alaskans can again schedule elective surgeries for on or after May 4 and visit their doctors for non-urgent needs.\n\nArizona\n\nGov. Doug Ducey issued a stay-at-home order that will expire on April 30.\n\n\"I want to get the economy moving and people back to work as soon as possible -- when it is safe and healthy for people to do so,\" Ducey said on Twitter on April 13.\n\nThe governor emphasized the importance of maintaining social distancing and continuing to make \"responsible choices.\"\n\n\"It's critical that we keep those efforts up as we plan for the future and a time when we can begin to return some normalcy to people's lives,\" Ducey said.\n\nArkansas\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson has not issued a stay-at-home order.\n\nSchools will be closed for the rest of the academic term. Fitness centers, bars, restaurants and other public spaces are closed until further notice.\n\nHutchinson told reporters on April 16 that he wants to bring back elective surgeries. \"We want to get (hospitals) back to doing the important health-care delivery that is important in our communities,\" he said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on March 19 that has no set end date.\n\nNewsom announced a joint Western States Pact with Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee on April 13.\n\n\"Health outcomes and science -- not politics -- will guide these decisions\" to reopen the states, according to a joint statement from the governors.\n\nNewsom outlined a framework for reopening the economy in the Golden State on Tuesday that he said was predicated on the state's ability to do six things: expand testing to identify and isolate the infected, maintain vigilance to protect seniors and high risk individuals, be able to meet future surges in hospitals with a \"myriad of protective gear,\" continue to collaborate with academia on therapies and treatments, redraw regulations to ensure continued physical distancing at businesses and schools and develop new enforcement mechanisms to allow the state to pull back and reinstate stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"I know you want the timeline, but we can't get ahead of ourselves and dream of regretting. Let's not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"I know you want the timeline, but we can't get ahead of ourselves ... Let's not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to,\" Newsom said.\n\nColorado\n\nGov. Jared Polis extended the state's stay-at-home order, which now remains in effect until April 26.\n\nHe said April 15 that the key information state officials need to determine when parts of the economy can be reopened is likely to come within the next five days.\n\nThe governor warned that restrictions won't all be lifted at the same time, and life will be different for some time. \"The virus will be with us,\" Polis said. \"We have to find a sustainable way that will be adapted in real time to how we live with it.\"\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont extended the mandatory shutdown in the state until May 20.\n\nConnecticut has joined a coalition with the Northeastern states of New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts to coordinate the reopening of the economy, according to a news release from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's office.\n\nLamont said he believed it would take at least another month before the state could decide on how and when to open things back up and emphasized \"this is no time to relax.\"\n\nLooking to revive the state's economy, Lamont announced Thursday the formation of the \"Reopen Connecticut Advisory Board.\"\n\nDelaware\n\nGov. John Carney issued a statewide stay-at-home order that will remain until May 15 or until the \"public health threat is eliminated.\"\n\n\n\nThe governor said April 17 that once the state reopens, social distancing, face coverings in public, washing hands, limited gatherings and vulnerable populations sheltering in place will remain.

Bowser extended a stay-at-home order until May 15.\n\n\"I don't know if that means we will be open on May 16, but it will be a point for us to check in. And if we need to extend it beyond that, we certainly will,\" Bowser said during April 15 media briefing.\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for Floridians until April 30.\n\nDeSantis plans to announce his reopening plan for the state of Florida next week, he said April 16.\n\nDuring a news conference Thursday, he suggested it could start with allowing elective surgeries.\n\nDeSantis said he will meet April 17 with a task force that includes experts across various industries throughout the state.\n\nSoutheast Florida, which is the epicenter of the outbreak in the state, could be treated differently than other parts, the governor said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGov.

Theaters and restaurants can reopen on April 27.\n\nBars, nightclubs and music venues will remain closed. The openings will be statewide, and local ordinances can't restrict them. All businesses that reopen must adhere to best practices, including social distancing and screening employees for illness.\n\nKemp had previously emphasized the importance of expanding testing before reopening the state.\n\n\"We're a little behind the curve from when our peak is going to be to other states around the country,\" Kemp said during an April 13 press briefing. \"That is certainly a day I am ready for, but I think today specifically we have been focused on the surge capacity, ramping up testing to do more than we're doing.\"\n\nHawaii\n\nGov. David Ige issued a stay-at-home order for Hawaii residents which will last through at least April 30.\n\nHe said Thursday the state doesn't satisfy the federal criteria for phased reopening, one of which is a 14-day downward trend in the number of cases. \"We're making progress, but we're not there yet, so please continue your hard work and perseverance, we will get through this together,\" he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nGov.

It is now effective through the end of the month.\n\nThe governor issued an \"Order to Self-Isolate\" which will expire on April 30 unless extended.\n\nLittle said that the measures were working and Idaho is \"truly seeing a flattening of the curve.\"\n\n\"Our goal is for most businesses to open after the end of the month, but with the understanding that it may not be possible if there's an upward trend in severe Covid-19 cases in Idaho between now and then,\" Little said.\n\nIllinois\n\nGov. J.B. Pritzker issued a stay-at-home order through at least April 30.\n\nPritzker said during a media briefing Monday that he believes the current state in Illinois has been enough to slowly start lifting shelter-in-place orders so that some industry workers can go back to work.\n\nAlthough there is no clear time line, he hopes that restarting production will go \"industry by industry, and maybe company by company.\"\n\nOn April 15 when asked about possibly extending the order into May he said: \"We're continuing to (consult health officials) and we'll be making announcements about our decisions over the next several days.\"\n\nIndiana\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb on April 17 extended the stay-at-home order through May 1.\n\nThe extension will give the state additional time to look into what the best way is to reopen sectors of the economy, Holcomb said.

Andy Beshear issued a \"Healthy at Home\" orde March 25 that is in effect indefinitely.\n\nKentucky is working with six other states to coordinate reopening measures.\n\nThe governor said April 16 it will be a phased-in approach \"where we can have that that symbiotic bump ... to make sure that the steps that we take ultimately have a bigger reward or bigger output, because they are being replicated in other areas that we already do so much business with.\"\n\nLouisiana\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30.\n\nThe governor announced on April 16 the formation of an economic recovery task force.\n\n\"They're going to look at our economy, make recommendations to make our businesses more resilient so that we can open them up, get businesses open, get workers back to work, but do so in a way that adequately affects public health,\" he said.\n\nMaine\n\nGov. Janet Mills issued a \"Stay Healthy at Home\" executive order through at least April 30. Mills extended the state's civil state of emergency until May 15.\n\n\"We are in the midst of one of the greatest public health crises this world has seen in more than a century,\" Mills said in a news release . \"This virus will continue to sicken people across our state; our cases will only grow, and more people will die. I say this to be direct, to be as honest with you as I can. Because saving lives will depend on us.\"\n\nMills said she wished she didn't have to extend the state of emergency, but \"the continued spread of the virus demands a sustained response by the State.\"\n\nMaine is in touch with neighbors New Hampshire and Vermont on reopening measures, the governor said April 14.\n\nMaryland\n\nGov. Larry Hogan issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 30. There is no current potential end date.\n\nThe governor said during his appearance on CNN Newsroom on April 13 that the state is discussing ways to safely reopen the state with health officials, and that his priority is to save lives, not the economy.\n\n\"We've got to listen to the doctors and scientists,\" Hogan said. \"We've also got to be concerned about people getting the help they need and getting on track, but doing so in a gradual and safe manner when it's really the right time to do it.\"\n\nHogan said a cooperation amongst other governors on when to reopen the states would be a \"good idea.\"\n\nPeople in Maryland will be required to wear face coverings in stores and on public transportation as of April 18.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGov.

Gretchen Whitmer extended the state's stay-at-home order through April 30.\n\nWhitmer said during Monday's press briefing that reopening the state's economy will be based on a \"data-driven approach based on facts, based on science, based on recommendations from experts.\"\n\nThe four factors the governor will take into consideration before reopening Michigan include a sustained reduction in cases, expanded testing and tracing capabilities, sufficient healthcare capacity, and the best practices for the workplace.\n\nAt the end of week that saw a protest at the Capitol and an anti-Whitmer tweet from Trump, the governor said April 17: \"There's no one I think is more eager to start reengaging sectors of our economy than I am. But the last thing I want to do is to have a second wave here and so we've got to be really smart.\"\n\nShe said the first businesses to reopen will be in low-risk sectors.\n\nMinnesota\n\nGov. Tim Walz extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 3.\n\nHe also signed an executive order extending the peacetime emergency for an additional 30 days until May 13.\n\nWalz emphasized the importance of expanding testing and tracing the spread of the virus before opening the state.\n\nThe governor's plan to open up the economy is to \"test, we have to do contact tracing, and we have to isolate the people who need to be isolated, and this has to be on a massive scale,\" Walz said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGov.

        "content_original": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China says calls for an investigation are an unwelcome distraction\n\nChina has rejected calls for an independent international investigation into the origin of the coronavirus.\n\nA top diplomat in the UK, Chen Wen told the BBC the demands were politically motivated and would divert China's attention from fighting the pandemic.\n\nInformation about the origin of Covid-19 and how it initially spread could help countries tackle the disease.\n\nThe virus is thought to have emerged at a wildlife market in the city of Wuhan late last year.\n\nMeanwhile an EU report accuses China of spreading disinformation about the crisis.\n\nThe bloc's External Action Service says Russia, and to a lesser extent China, have \"targeted conspiracy narratives\" in the EU and neighbouring countries.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has also repeatedly attacked China for its handling of the outbreak, and the state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government, accusing it of doing little to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nScientists have poured cold water on speculation that the virus could have been engineered in a Wuhan laboratory.\n\nWhat is China objecting to?\n\nAlmost from the start of the pandemic, there have been calls for international investigators to be allowed into China to find out how it all started.\n\nOn Thursday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that he would push for an investigation at the annual meeting next month of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO). Australia sits on the executive board of the assembly.\n\nThe body already plans to discuss calls for a \"lessons learned\" review of health emergencies.\n\nBut Ms Chen told the BBC her country could not agree to any international investigation.\n\n\"The independent inquiry is politically motivated,\" she said.\n\n\"We are fighting the virus at the moment, we are concentrating all our efforts on fighting against the virus. Why talk about an investigation into this? This will divert not only attention, it will divert resources.\n\n\"This is a politically motivated initiative, I think no-one can agree on this... It would serve nobody any good.\"\n\nMs Chen said there were lots of rumours about the origins of the virus but such misinformation was dangerous, she claimed, and said it was like a political virus and as dangerous as coronavirus itself, if not even more so.\n\nEuropeans 'nervous' about confronting China\n\nGovernments in Europe have so far been wary of engaging in a diplomatic row with China at a sensitive time.\n\nOne UK official, who like others declined to speak on the record, said there was a \"nervousness\" about confronting China and that relations were \"delicate\".\n\nCountries are dependent on Beijing for deliveries of vital equipment in dealing with the crisis and want to keep the flow of information open to help understand what happened this time and prevent future outbreaks, and experts say the approach needs to be carefully calibrated.\n\n\"We need to dial down the rhetoric and the confrontation because we've got something more serious to deal with,\" argues Charles Parton, a former UK diplomat in China and now a senior associate fellow at the RUSI think- tank.\n\nIn the US by contrast, the issue of China is becoming highly politicised in an election year with competing calls for a tough line on Beijing and pressure to investigate the origins of the virus.\n\nRead more from Gordon here.\n\nWhat does the EU report say?\n\n\"Despite their potentially grave impact on public health, official and state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and - to a lesser extent - China, have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighbourhood,\" the report says.\n\nIt claims Chinese officials and state media have been trying to deflect blame for the outbreak, curtailing any mentions of Wuhan as the origin of the virus, with some state-controlled social media channels continuing to spread the theory that the outbreak was linked to visiting US military representatives.\n\nThe authors also say there is \"significant evidence of covert Chinese operations on social media\", citing reports of networks on Twitter with ties to the Chinese government.\n\nThe report also singles out Russia for spreading disinformation, saying pro-Kremlin sources and Russian state media were continuing to run a coordinated campaign with the aim of undermining the EU and its crisis response and sowing confusion about the origins and health implications of Coronavirus.",

        "content": "( CNN ) The novel coronavirus can infect anyone , but it 's older adults \u2014 ages 60 and up \u2014 who are more likely to get seriously sick from it .\nSome tips are applicable to every generation , but there are specific precautions older adults should take to protect their health .\nWe spoke to two geriatricians and pulled guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assemble what people 60 and up need to know about the novel coronavirus .\nYou can download a sheet of that information ( in English , Spanish and Chinese ) and share with your loved ones . But remember : Recommendations for Covid-19 may change as officials learn more , so monitor your local health department and the CDC for updates .\nThe CDC says `` older adults '' and people with severe chronic illness are more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19 .\nInfectious disease experts define `` older adults '' as anyone age 60 and up , so people in that age group should be cautious .\nIt 's possible to contract the virus at a younger age \u2014 it 's just more dangerous in older adults because the immune system weakens with age , said Dr. Samir Sinha , director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto .\nPeople over the age of 80 may want to exercise even more caution . A report published in the medical journal JAMA that examined more than 72,000 Chinese coronavirus patients found that the overall fatality rate was 2.3 % . But in adults over 80 , the fatality rate rose to 15 % .\nIf you live in a community where there 's an outbreak , you 're at a higher risk of infection , too . Follow the advice below .\nCancel all non-essential doctor 's appointments , said Dr. Carla Perissinotto , an associate professor in the Geriatrics Division of the University of California-San Francisco 's Department of Medicine .\nWhether it 's a standard check-up , a follow-up appointment for a stable condition or an elective procedure , if it can wait , then it should .\nIf you have an important appointment coming up , consider doing it in a video call or from your smartphone . Telehealth tech lets physicians confer with patients who may not be able to leave their homes .\nTell a friend , a loved one , a co-worker or a neighbor if you 're concerned about the illness . Appoint one of them as an emergency contact who you can call with concerns or requests for help .\nOtherwise , do what you 'd do during flu season : Wash your hands frequently , the right way ( get ready to read that a lot ) . Use hand sanitizer when soap and water are n't available , though washing your hands is preferred .\nThe CDC recommends keeping enough groceries and toiletries on hand to last you a `` prolonged period of time .

        "content_original": "(CNN) The novel coronavirus can infect anyone, but it's older adults \u2014 ages 60 and up \u2014 who are more likely to get seriously sick from it.\n\nSome tips are applicable to every generation, but there are specific precautions older adults should take to protect their health.\n\nWe spoke to two geriatricians and pulled guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assemble what people 60 and up need to know about the novel coronavirus.\n\nYou can download a sheet of that information (in English, Spanish and Chinese) and share with your loved ones. But remember: Recommendations for Covid-19 may change as officials learn more, so monitor your local health department and the CDC for updates.\n\nWhat's your risk level\n\nThe CDC says \"older adults\" and people with severe chronic illness are more likely to become severely ill from Covid-19.\n\nInfectious disease experts define \"older adults\" as anyone age 60 and up, so people in that age group should be cautious.\n\nIt's possible to contract the virus at a younger age \u2014 it's just more dangerous in older adults because the immune system weakens with age, said Dr. Samir Sinha, director of Geriatrics for the Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto.\n\nPeople over the age of 80 may want to exercise even more caution. A report published in the medical journal JAMA that examined more than 72,000 Chinese coronavirus patients found that the overall fatality rate was 2.3%. But in adults over 80, the fatality rate rose to 15%.\n\nIf you live in a community where there's an outbreak, you're at a higher risk of infection, too. Follow the advice below.\n\nWhat precautions you should take now\n\nCancel all non-essential doctor's appointments, said Dr. Carla Perissinotto, an associate professor in the Geriatrics Division of the University of California-San Francisco's Department of Medicine.\n\nWhether it's a standard check-up, a follow-up appointment for a stable condition or an elective procedure, if it can wait, then it should.\n\nIf you have an important appointment coming up, consider doing it in a video call or from your smartphone. Telehealth tech lets physicians confer with patients who may not be able to leave their homes.\n\nTell a friend, a loved one, a co-worker or a neighbor if you're concerned about the illness. Appoint one of them as an emergency contact who you can call with concerns or requests for help.\n\nOtherwise, do what you'd do during flu season: Wash your hands frequently , the right way (get ready to read that a lot). Use hand sanitizer when soap and water aren't available, though washing your hands is preferred.\n\nWhat you should stock up on\n\nThe CDC recommends keeping enough groceries and toiletries on hand to last you a \"prolonged period of time.\" There's no timeline for the Covid-19 outbreak, though, so think basic.\n\nStock up on toothpaste, detergent, water filters, etc.\n\nMake meals and freeze them if you're concerned about food.\n\nBut stocking up on medication ahead of time isn't always plausible, Perissinotto said. You may be able to switch to a 90-day supply for your prescription. If this isn't possible, the CDC suggests mail ordering medications.\n\nHow you should alter daily activities\n\nOlder adults living in communities where the virus has spread should take extra precautions.\n\nAvoid public places where crowds may gather or poorly ventilated buildings where the risk of transmission is higher, the CDC said.\n\nRestrict your time in public and limit close contact.\n\nOlder adults should still exercise and eat right, just as they would at any other time of the year, Sinha said.\n\nAnd again, constant \u2014 and proper \u2014 handwashing before, during and after a trip into the public is necessary.\n\nHow you should handle travel\n\nThe CDC advises against non-essential plane travel for older adults. Several US airlines have already slashed their flight schedules for the next few months.\n\nIt's wise to stay off cruise ships for now, too. Cruise passengers are at an increased risk of person-to-person transmission with all the tight quarters, the CDC said , so if you're already made cruise plans, it's best to cancel them.\n\nWhat you need to know about self-isolation\n\nThe CDC recommends that high-risk groups in communities with outbreaks stay home as much as possible and that people who believe they're sick isolate themselves.\n\nIsolation can be damaging, too, if you cut off contact and are lonely.\n\n\"I don't think the solution of totally being devoid of social contact is the answer,\" Perissinotto said. \"Yes, there is some prudence we need to have in social distancing, but we also have to be careful to not isolate more -- it can be very detrimental.\"\n\nSo if you're self-isolating:\n\nDon't cut off contact with family or friends.\n\nKeep in touch to update them on your condition and curb boredom.\n\nAnd if you do go out, be sure to wash your hands with soap.\n\nWhat your family can do\n\nTo help you, your family should think ahead.\n\nPerissinotto recommends that family, friends and neighbors of older adults do some inventory in case the older adult needs to isolate at home.\n\nDoes this person have what they need to spend an extended period of time inside? If not, help them prepare supplies.\n\nIf their caregiver calls in sick, is there someone who can step in to take care of them? Have a plan in place to make sure they'll get care if they need it.\n\nIf they have a telemedicine appointment coming up, will they know how to access it? Set up the tech and show them how to use it to speak with their physician.\n\nGetting prepared and keeping in touch can help keep families connected if an older member needs to isolate, Perissinotto said.\n\nAnd, of course, sick family members should not visit \u2014 stick to a phone or video call. And if a younger, healthy family member has potentially come into contact with a Covid-19 patient, they should self-isolate and avoid seeing older, susceptible family members.\n\nWhat you should consider about nursing homes\n\nIt's natural to be fearful for family in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, Sinha said: Older people and people with chronic illnesses, both high-risk groups, are living together in tight quarters.\n\nThe good news: Most nursing homes and long-term care facilities are prepared for pandemics, Perissonotto said.\n\nThe CDC provides training for long-term care facilities on how to operate during pandemics.

        "content": "( CNN ) When Covid-19 suddenly ravaged New York , hospitals looked `` apocalyptic . '' Refrigerated trucks turned into morgues because there was n't enough space for all the victims .\nThat was March . Three months later , the state had `` done a full 180 , from worst to first , '' Gov . Andrew Cuomo said .\nNow , the rates of infection , hospitalizations or deaths have plummeted in New York and several other states -- paving the way for full economic reopenings .\nIt 's the opposite of what 's happening in most of the US , where the virus is surging and more than half the states have paused or backtracked their reopenings .\nHere 's how some states have helped get coronavirus under control -- and what they 're doing to make sure it stays that way :\nConnecticut has consistently had one of the lowest rates of transmission ( R numbers ) of any state in the country . An R number represents how many people each infected person is likely to go on and infect , on average .\nConnecticut has an R number of about 0.90 . That means fewer and fewer people are getting infected in the state .\nAnd the number of new deaths has plummeted since April 26 , when the seven-day average of daily deaths was 113 . That number has stayed below 5 every day since July 2 , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .\nMany other states did n't start requiring masks until two months later .\nIt also reopened later than many states , starting on May 20 .\nAnd like New York and New Jersey , Connecticut has required visitors from states with high rates of Covid-19 to quarantine for 14 days\nHow they 're planning to keep a lid on the virus :\nEven though Connecticut had some of the best numbers in the nation , Gov . Ned Lamont decided not to move forward with Phase 3 reopening plans on July 6 . That meant bars will remain closed , and restaurants must stay at 50 % capacity .\n`` Look , I like a beer at the bar as much as the next person . I know how frustrating this can be , '' Lamont said . `` But right now , with this pandemic flaring up in a majority of other states , this is not the time to take a risk . ''\nLamont also said the state would hold off on allowing outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people .\nCDC director : The 'most powerful weapon ' against Covid-19 is social distancing\nNew York started Phase 2 of its reopening on May 29 , allowing office-based work , in-store retail shopping and some barbershop services to resume in much of the state .\nAnd between May 29 and July 10 , average daily new cases in New York state has dropped about 55 % -- from about 1,447 new cases a day to 651 cases a day , according to data from Johns Hopkins .\nNew York has by far the most Covid-19 deaths in the country , with more than 32,000 since the pandemic began .\nOn Monday , New York City reported no new deaths from Covid-19 for the first time in months .\nOn March 20 , as Covid-19 was spiraling out of control in New York , Gov . Andrew Cuomo announced all employees of nonessential businesses must stay home . It was one of the earliest shutdown mandates in the country .\n`` If someone is unhappy , if somebody wants to blame someone , or complain about someone , blame me . There is no one else who is responsible for this decision , '' Cuomo said that day . `` This is not life as usual . And accept it and realize it and deal with it . ''\nAnd at a time when testing was scarce across the country , New York tried to ramp up capabilities on its own . With FDA approval , New York state announced on March 13 it could authorize 28 public and private labs to start testing for coronavirus -- the first state to do so .\n`` We 're hunting positives , '' Cuomo said in March . `` We 're hunting positives so we can isolate them and reduce the spread . ''\nNew Yorkers tuned into Cuomo 's daily briefings for updates on the virus and how to stay safe . During his 111th and final daily briefing on June 19 , Cuomo said the state had gone `` from worst to first . ''\nHe credited residents who followed guidance , stayed home , and wore masks when they had to go out in public .\n`` This was n't only about what government did . This was about what people did , '' Cuomo said . `` Together , New Yorkers bent the curve because we acted responsibly and we looked out for each other . Now we must stay the course . ''\nAs a popular tourist destination , New York is trying to prevent visitors from spreading the virus . So anyone coming from a state where coronavirus is surging must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival .\n`` The quarantine applies to any person arriving from a state with a positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or a state with a 10 % or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average , '' the governor 's office said .\nAs of Tuesday , 22 states were on that travel advisory . Those arriving at a New York airport must fill out a traveler form .\n`` Travelers who leave the airport without completing the form will be subject to a $ 2,000 fine and may be brought to a hearing and ordered to complete mandatory quarantine , '' the governor 's office said .\nNew York also released concrete metrics for when to allow schools to reopen , and when classes would need to go virtual if the situation gets worse .\nWhile some have accused Cuomo of prematurely taking a victory lap , the governor 's website stresses the fight is not over :\n`` Coronavirus is still active in New York , '' the top of the website reads . `` We have to be smart . Wear a mask and maintain 6 feet distance in public . ''\nMassachusetts started reopening on May 25 . But since then , the rate of new cases has gone down , not up .\nBetween May 25 and July 10 , the rate of daily new cases in Massachusetts has dropped by 75 % , according to data from Johns Hopkins University .\nBetween April 15 and July 14 , Covid-19 hospitalizations have dropped by about 84 % , and the rate of new deaths has dropped by about 95 % , according to data from the Massachusetts Department of Health .\nMassachusetts waited to start reopening and was one of the last states to do so .\nIt also enacted a mask mandate before most other states did , on May 6 . But unlike some states , the mandate in Massachusetts also applies to outdoor public areas where it might not be possible to stay 6 feet away from others .\nMassachusetts is doubling down on testing to try to snuff out coronavirus in the state .\nThis month , Gov . Charlie Baker announced a `` Stop the Spread '' testing initiative that will last until mid-August .\nThe effort will focus on eight communities where the rates of Covid-19 are higher than the statewide average .\n`` The goal of this initiative is to provide widespread asymptomatic testing in an easy-to-access location within these communities '' to help stop community spread , Baker said .\nAnd Massachusetts is aiming to resume classroom education this fall -- but with face masks and distancing rules .\n`` Students in grade 2 and above are required to wear a mask/face covering that covers their nose and mouth , '' according to initial guidance from the state education department . The same applies to teachers and staff members .\nFor those unable to wear a mask , face shields may be used . And mask breaks should occur throughout the day if there 's adequate distancing or ventilation .\nNew Jersey was hit hard early in this pandemic , with hospitalizations and deaths soaring . The state has the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths per capita : 175 per 100,000 people .\nBut now , New Jersey is among just a handful of states on track to contain Covid-19 , according to CovidActNow.org , which tracks each state in four key areas : the infection rate , the test positivity rate , hospital capacity and contact tracing ability .\nWhile testing has increased , the rate of new cases has decreased . New Jersey now has a test positivity rate of about 1.3 % .\nAnd the rate of transmission ( Rt ) is about 0.91 , which means fewer and fewer people are getting infected .\nIn mid-March , Gov . Phil Murphy activated the National Guard and issued sweeping orders , including :\n-- The closure of all schools and universities starting on March 18\n-- The closure of all casinos , racetracks , theaters and gyms\n-- The closure of all nonessential retail , recreational and entertainment businesses after 8 p.m. each day\nNew Jersey was the first state to issue a mask mandate , back on April 8 .\nBusinesses must provide masks to employees and deny entry to any customer who refuse to wear them inside the business . Those riding public transit in the state must also wear face masks .\nNew Jersey also joined forces with New York and Connecticut on requiring visitors from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days .\nHow New Jersey is trying to keep Covid-19 under control :\nOfficials are urging residents not to get complacent just because the numbers have improved .\n`` Our rate of transmission is in a good place today , but only a week ago ... it was above 1.0 , '' the governor said Monday .\n`` And if we change course , it 's going to not only rise , but so will the number of positive test results , so will the number of hospitalizations , and so will the number , sadly , of residents who pass . ''\nVermont has the lowest test positivity rate in the nation -- 0.78 % as of Wednesday , according to Johns Hopkins University .\nIt also has the 3rd lowest number of coronavirus cases per capita and the 10th lowest Covid-19 death rate of any state .\nContact tracing has steadily improved in Vermont -- from an average of 2.7 contacts made per case in April to 4.8 contacts made per case in June .\nAs of last week , `` 2,469 contacts have been identified , '' the Vermont Department of Health said .\n`` 172 contacts became a COVID-19 case . This means that this group of people knew to stay home , and likely did not spread the virus further . ''\nWhen schools reopen this fall , `` All staff and students are required to wear facial coverings while in the building , as well as outside where physical distancing can not be maintained , '' according to guidance issued last month by state health and education officials . That guidance could change before the school year starts .\nAnd despite having the lowest test positivity rate in the country , Vermont 's state of emergency will be extended for another month , Gov . Phil Scott announced Tuesday .\n`` It 's the vehicle we need to keep certain protections in place ( and ) control outbreaks as they come up , so we can keep the economy open and manage this ongoing crisis , '' Scott said .\n`` As long as the data stays consistent , we will stick with our effort to incrementally lift restrictions and get closer to a point where this order is no longer necessary .

With FDA approval, New York state announced on March 13 it could authorize 28 public and private labs to start testing for coronavirus -- the first state to do so.\n\n\"We're hunting positives,\" Cuomo said in March. \"We're hunting positives so we can isolate them and reduce the spread.\"\n\nNew Yorkers tuned into Cuomo's daily briefings for updates on the virus and how to stay safe. During his 111th and final daily briefing on June 19, Cuomo said the state had gone \"from worst to first.\"\n\nHe credited residents who followed guidance, stayed home, and wore masks when they had to go out in public.\n\n\"This wasn't only about what government did. This was about what people did,\" Cuomo said. \"Together, New Yorkers bent the curve because we acted responsibly and we looked out for each other. Now we must stay the course.\"\n\nHow they're planning to stay the course:\n\nAs a popular tourist destination, New York is trying to prevent visitors from spreading the virus. So anyone coming from a state where coronavirus is surging must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.\n\n\"The quarantine applies to any person arriving from a state with a positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a 7-day rolling average or a state with a 10% or higher positivity rate over a 7-day rolling average,\" the governor's office said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 22 states were on that travel advisory. Those arriving at a New York airport must fill out a traveler form.\n\n\"Travelers who leave the airport without completing the form will be subject to a $2,000 fine and may be brought to a hearing and ordered to complete mandatory quarantine,\" the governor's office said.\n\nNew York also released concrete metrics for when to allow schools to reopen, and when classes would need to go virtual if the situation gets worse.\n\nWhile some have accused Cuomo of prematurely taking a victory lap, the governor's website stresses the fight is not over:\n\n\"Coronavirus is still active in New York,\" the top of the website reads. \"We have to be smart. Wear a mask and maintain 6 feet distance in public.\"\n\nMassachusetts\n\nHow much the state improved:\n\nMassachusetts started reopening on May 25. But since then, the rate of new cases has gone down, not up.\n\nBetween May 25 and July 10, the rate of daily new cases in Massachusetts has dropped by 75%, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBetween April 15 and July 14, Covid-19 hospitalizations have dropped by about 84%, and the rate of new deaths has dropped by about 95%, according to data from the Massachusetts Department of Health.\n\nHow they helped quell coronavirus:\n\nMassachusetts waited to start reopening and was one of the last states to do so.\n\nIt also enacted a mask mandate before most other states did, on May 6. But unlike some states, the mandate in Massachusetts also applies to outdoor public areas where it might not be possible to stay 6 feet away from others.\n\nHow they're planning to keep Covid-19 under control:\n\nMassachusetts is doubling down on testing to try to snuff out coronavirus in the state.\n\nThis month, Gov. Charlie Baker announced a \"Stop the Spread\" testing initiative that will last until mid-August.\n\nThe effort will focus on eight communities where the rates of Covid-19 are higher than the statewide average.\n\n\"The goal of this initiative is to provide widespread asymptomatic testing in an easy-to-access location within these communities\" to help stop community spread, Baker said.\n\nAnd Massachusetts is aiming to resume classroom education this fall -- but with face masks and distancing rules.\n\n\"Students in grade 2 and above are required to wear a mask/face covering that covers their nose and mouth,\" according to initial guidance from the state education department. The same applies to teachers and staff members.\n\nFor those unable to wear a mask, face shields may be used. And mask breaks should occur throughout the day if there's adequate distancing or ventilation.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHow the state has improved:\n\nNew Jersey was hit hard early in this pandemic, with hospitalizations and deaths soaring. The state has the highest rate of Covid-19 deaths per capita: 175 per 100,000 people.\n\nBut now, New Jersey is among just a handful of states on track to contain Covid-19, according to CovidActNow.org, which tracks each state in four key areas: the infection rate, the test positivity rate, hospital capacity and contact tracing ability.\n\nWhile testing has increased, the rate of new cases has decreased. New Jersey now has a test positivity rate of about 1.3%.\n\nAnd the rate of transmission (Rt) is about 0.91, which means fewer and fewer people are getting infected.\n\nHow New Jersey helped changed its course:\n\nIn mid-March, Gov. Phil Murphy activated the National Guard and issued sweeping orders, including:\n\n-- The closure of all schools and universities starting on March 18\n\n-- The closure of all casinos, racetracks, theaters and gyms\n\n-- The closure of all nonessential retail, recreational and entertainment businesses after 8 p.m. each day\n\nNew Jersey was the first state to issue a mask mandate, back on April 8.\n\nBusinesses must provide masks to employees and deny entry to any customer who refuse to wear them inside the business. Those riding public transit in the state must also wear face masks.\n\nNew Jersey also joined forces with New York and Connecticut on requiring visitors from hot-spot states to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nHow New Jersey is trying to keep Covid-19 under control:\n\nOfficials are urging residents not to get complacent just because the numbers have improved.\n\n\"Our rate of transmission is in a good place today, but only a week ago ... it was above 1.0,\" the governor said Monday.\n\n\"And if we change course, it's going to not only rise, but so will the number of positive test results, so will the number of hospitalizations, and so will the number, sadly, of residents who pass.\"\n\nVermont\n\nHow well the state is doing:\n\nVermont has the lowest test positivity rate in the nation -- 0.78% as of Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIt also has the 3rd lowest number of coronavirus cases per capita and the 10th lowest Covid-19 death rate of any state.\n\nHow they helped keep their numbers low:\n\nContact tracing has steadily improved in Vermont -- from an average of 2.7 contacts made per case in April to 4.8 contacts made per case in June.\n\nAs of last week, \"2,469 contacts have been identified,\" the Vermont Department of Health said.\n\n\"172 contacts became a COVID-19 case. This means that this group of people knew to stay home, and likely did not spread the virus further.\"\n\nHow they're planning to keep Covid-19 under control:\n\nWhen schools reopen this fall, \"All staff and students are required to wear facial coverings while in the building, as well as outside where physical distancing cannot be maintained,\" according to guidance issued last month by state health and education officials. That guidance could change before the school year starts.\n\nAnd despite having the lowest test positivity rate in the country, Vermont's state of emergency will be extended for another month, Gov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday.\n\n\"It's the vehicle we need to keep certain protections in place (and) control outbreaks as they come up, so we can keep the economy open and manage this ongoing crisis,\" Scott said.\n\n\"As long as the data stays consistent, we will stick with our effort to incrementally lift restrictions and get closer to a point where this order is no longer necessary.\"",

Sign up here .\nOver the past decade , the U.S. government spent nearly $ 100 billion on preparation for major health crises including pandemics , according to a 2018 paper on such funding -- though the coronavirus outbreak still had Washington and states across the country scrambling to muster supplies and respond when it hit .\nNumbers from a paper in the academic journal `` Health Security '' released in late 2018 indicate that the government spent between $ 10 billion and $ 12 billion each year from 2010 to 2018 across several agencies on programs that contribute to `` biosecurity , '' the management of `` pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases , '' and `` multiple-hazard and general preparedness '' programs that assist in readiness for and response to different types of health threats , including diseases like the coronavirus .\nCOVID-19 seems to be the kind of problem the U.S. was preparing for , but a debate has raged in Washington over whether the money was spent effectively .\nTRUMP SET TO PRESIDE OVER RECORD SPENDING , DEFICITS AS CORONAVIRUS COSTS EXPLODE\n`` Ventilators , which were few & in bad shape , are now being ... produced in the thousands , and we have many to spare , '' President Trump said in a Wednesday tweet thread , alluding to how the U.S. did not have the resources it needed at the outset of the pandemic . `` We are helping other countries which are desperate for them . Likewise , after having been left little , we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined , and with superior tests . Face masks & shields ... gloves , gowns , etc . are now plentiful . ''\nDemocrats have countered that GOP-driven budget cuts early in the decade squeezed areas like the stockpile of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .\nTrump was also faulted for initially downplaying the coronavirus threat , as did many in the media and some Democrats like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio . But even when state and federal responses kicked into full gear they struggled to get medical supplies like ventilators and PPE to front-line health care workers . Additionally , federal and state governments are still working to secure enough coronavirus tests to open their economies , with some reaching out to other countries -- in Maryland 's case , South Korea .\nThe White House coronavirus task force said last week it is working to expedite the production of a coronavirus vaccine , but it is still unclear when such a vaccine could become available , with some estimates placing the timeline at about 18 months despite prior plans that aimed for a faster timetable -- at least for unknown flu strains . The Strategic National Stockpile has only helped on the margins , and the Trump administration has had mixed success , at best , in using the Defense Production Act to get domestic industries to produce ventilators , testing swabs and PPE .\nTREASURY TO BORROW $ 3T FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF , ADDING MORE DEBT IN 1 QUARTER THAN ALL OF 2019\n`` Our country is unable to meet an immediate need for critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment in the face of a crisis , '' Scott Paul , the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing , said in a New York Times op-ed . `` The absence of adequate domestic production capacity for things like face shields and respirators , coupled with the frailty of on-demand global supply chains and our utter reliance on them \u2014 for everything from the ingredients in our medications to parts of breathing machines \u2014 has left us dangerously exposed during an international health emergency . ''\nThe slow coronavirus response from all levels of government , particularly the federal government , came despite significant funding over the past decade for programs across multiple agencies , including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) under the Department of Defense ( DOD ) ; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease Programs under the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) ; the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease research program , also under HHS ; and others .\nThe `` Health Security '' paper , titled `` Federal Funding for Health Security in FY2019 , '' also recorded government spending in preparation for nuclear and chemical threats , which Fox News has excluded from this analysis . It also analyzes the president 's 2019 budget , data which is excluded as well because presidential budgets do not reflect actual or estimated spending .\nThe government 's struggles dealing with increased hospitalizations and demand on medical equipment were largely cited as reasons why widespread economic shutdowns were needed , as government officials and health experts stressed the need to `` flatten the curve '' of coronavirus infections in the United States . The resulting economic hardships forced Congress to take drastic measures to prop up the economy and Americans ' everyday finances , including the $ 2.2 trillion CARES Act , which is ballooning the federal deficit to a projected $ 3.7 trillion for 2020 , according to the Congressional Budget Office , with three other coronavirus spending bills already passed and another , potentially $ 1 trillion-plus , piece of legislation being considered .\nCOUNTIES DEFYING STATE CORONAVIRUS 'STAY-AT-HOME ' ORDERS AND REOPENING FOR BUSINESS\nPenn State Assistant Professor of Public Policy Simon Haeder , who specializes in health policy , noted some of the shortfalls -- and highlights -- in U.S. preparation for the coronavirus .\nHaeder specifically complimented the many highly trained and educated workers -- largely because of programs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) -- available in the U.S. to plan responses , strong research capabilities at American universities and creative members of the private sector willing to respond to the public health crisis .\n`` I think we had good infrastructure in place , or we had people thinking about this , the CDC has good training programs , I think that was one of the benefits we had , '' he said . `` The CDC has a special training program that trains people and puts them back into the community as doctors , researchers and those kinds of things that are supposed to spot developments on the ground as they happen , and I think we are ahead of a lot of other countries when it comes to that . ''\nUnderscoring Haeder 's point , the Global Health Security Index , which is put together by the Nuclear Threat Initiative -- an organization that works on both nuclear security and biosecurity -- ranked the U.S. as the most prepared of 195 countries ranked to deal with threats to its health security .\nBut , he said , as states begin to reopen their economies , the U.S. is not in a much better place than it was at the outset of the pandemic .\n`` A month ago or two months ago we did n't have a solution to the virus . We do n't have any treatment that really works and we do n't have any way to vaccinate people , '' Haeder said . `` Now we were able to withstand the initial onslaught of what was coming , but ... the same problem exists today . We do n't have any treatment , and we do n't have any vaccine . And the only thing we 've done is we 've not overwhelmed , in most places ... the health care system yet , '' by flattening the coronavirus curve with economic shutdowns .\nIt 's a common misconception that business closures and stay-at-home orders aimed at `` flattening the curve '' are meant to reduce the total number of people who will fall ill because of the coronavirus . Rather , these curve-flattening measures are meant largely to reduce the number of people who are sick at any given time , thus avoiding a surge in cases that overwhelms the health care system and causes otherwise preventable deaths because not all patients are able to access lifesaving critical care .\nTREASURY TO BORROW $ 3T FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF , ADDING MORE DEBT IN 1 QUARTER THAN ALL OF 2019\nOutside of a few hotspots , the U.S. has largely accomplished the goal . Most hospitals are not overwhelmed and the death rate from the coronavirus in the U.S. is either in line with or lower than that of other countries . But that has come with the drastic economic costs stemming from the large-scale shutdowns that made it possible .\nAccording to Haeder , despite what the government spent in the past decade to deal with health threats , it neglected to ensure there was a supply of medical means to keep the coronavirus from upending daily life in the way it has .\n`` We could keep more things open longer if our capacity to respond to this would have been higher , '' Haeder said . `` For sure , the curve that you 're able to sustain medically is a lot higher if you 're prepared . ''\nAchieving that capacity , Haeder said , would mean more concerted efforts to store things like ventilators and N95 masks , moving the production of many medical products back to the U.S. from India and China , and ensuring that U.S. industry has the ability to quickly ramp up the production of essential items when called upon .\nALARM BELLS SOUND OVER HISTORIC DEFICIT SPENDING , AS CORONAVIRUS BILLS COULD NEAR $ 5T\nThose measures , of course , would cost even more money . But Haeder says they would be worth it considering the United States ' yearly health preparedness expenditures are dwarfed by the economic costs of responding to the crisis -- the CARES Act alone outsizes the government 's yearly spending on health preparedness by a factor of about 200 .\n`` We 're hit with two things right now , '' he said . `` We 're hit with the fallout from the medical issue of dealing with the virus , but it 's made much , much worse from the economic side because the economic side will be with us for a very long time . There 's a massive dip in income , lots of people lost their jobs . Lots of them will have lost their jobs permanently ... the debt has massively increased , and we could have dealt with a lot of that off-hand if we would have been better prepared . ''\nThe kind of efforts that would have allowed the U.S. to remain largely open , or at least more than it has , would be expensive , Haeder said . But he said `` no '' and laughed at the suggestion that their cost could approach $ 2.2 trillion .\n`` While I ca n't give you any numbers , I think you can make a sound case that spending just a little bit of money upfront is gon na be a really , really good investment , '' Haeder said , mentioning that there are ways , like rotating stocked-up supplies and selling them before they expire , to cut costs .\nHaeder also suggested that a lack of planning and organization on how governments and institutions coordinate their responses contributed to the severity of the pandemic in the U.S .\n`` When people got on Jared [ Kushner ] 's good side , they were able to get stuff . And , you know , when they could explain that they really needed it . I do n't think that 's a good way to handle a nationwide catastrophe , but I think we really need to think about how we put those lines of communication and lines of resources in place from a government-to-government perspective , '' Haeder said .\nMCCONNELL , SCHUMER SPAR OVER HEALTH OF LAWMAKERS AS SENATE CONVENES FOR FIRST TIME IN WEEKS\nSuch measures , involving more planning than spending money on tangible things , would also be a lot cheaper than economic stimulus after the fact . Trump critics often note that the Obama administration created a pandemic playbook and a council to prepare for and coordinate pandemic responses . The Trump administration eliminated the council and merged its responsibilities with other bodies during a reorganization of the National Security Council , and it did not use the playbook .\nOf course , there is rarely much appetite from lawmakers to funnel any amount of taxpayer money into preparing for invisible , undefined threats that may appear sometime in the future . There are other issues more palatable to voters -- like tax cuts , entitlement programs or infrastructure .\nCalls for increased health preparedness for future health crises have emerged in the wake of recent ones -- there are already people using the phrase `` never again '' about the coronavirus -- but if the current pandemic follows the same pattern as past health scares , those calls may die down eventually .\nAn example of this phenomenon can be found in New York City , which in 2006 under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg moved forward with an aggressive plan to prepare for a pandemic similar to the coronavirus .\nBut , in a story first reported by ProPublica , the city never purchased even half of the ventilators that it planned to . And those it did buy were eventually auctioned off because of the costs of maintaining and storing them , and the company that manufactured the ventilators stopped making the model the city bought .\nThe city also stocked up on N95 masks , but , the city 's health department told ProPublica , they `` all expired , and it became cost-prohibitive to replace them in any meaningful quantity . ''\nDespite the costs and challenges , Haeder said , improving stockpiles of medical equipment and government planning would be a good investment for the next time a coronavirus-level pandemic hits .\n`` The argument that I 'm making is if you 're prepared , then your measures to deal with this do n't have to be so draconian and ... we would have been able to keep more stuff open longer , and keep interaction to a degree up longer , and keep businesses open .

Likewise, after having been left little, we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined, and with superior tests. Face masks & shields ... gloves, gowns, etc. are now plentiful.\"\n\nDemocrats have countered that GOP-driven budget cuts early in the decade squeezed areas like the stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nTrump was also faulted for initially downplaying the coronavirus threat, as did many in the media and some Democrats like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. But even when state and federal responses kicked into full gear they struggled to get medical supplies like ventilators and PPE to front-line health care workers. Additionally, federal and state governments are still working to secure enough coronavirus tests to open their economies, with some reaching out to other countries -- in Maryland's case, South Korea.\n\nThe White House coronavirus task force said last week it is working to expedite the production of a coronavirus vaccine, but it is still unclear when such a vaccine could become available, with some estimates placing the timeline at about 18 months despite prior plans that aimed for a faster timetable -- at least for unknown flu strains. The Strategic National Stockpile has only helped on the margins, and the Trump administration has had mixed success, at best, in using the Defense Production Act to get domestic industries to produce ventilators, testing swabs and PPE.\n\nTREASURY TO BORROW $3T FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, ADDING MORE DEBT IN 1 QUARTER THAN ALL OF 2019\n\n\"Our country is unable to meet an immediate need for critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment in the face of a crisis,\" Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a New York Times op-ed. \"The absence of adequate domestic production capacity for things like face shields and respirators, coupled with the frailty of on-demand global supply chains and our utter reliance on them \u2014 for everything from the ingredients in our medications to parts of breathing machines \u2014 has left us dangerously exposed during an international health emergency.\"\n\nThe slow coronavirus response from all levels of government, particularly the federal government, came despite significant funding over the past decade for programs across multiple agencies, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under the Department of Defense (DOD); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Disease Programs under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Disease research program, also under HHS; and others.\n\nThe \"Health Security\" paper, titled \"Federal Funding for Health Security in FY2019,\" also recorded government spending in preparation for nuclear and chemical threats, which Fox News has excluded from this analysis. It also analyzes the president's 2019 budget, data which is excluded as well because presidential budgets do not reflect actual or estimated spending.\n\nThe government's struggles dealing with increased hospitalizations and demand on medical equipment were largely cited as reasons why widespread economic shutdowns were needed, as government officials and health experts stressed the need to \"flatten the curve\" of coronavirus infections in the United States. The resulting economic hardships forced Congress to take drastic measures to prop up the economy and Americans' everyday finances, including the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, which is ballooning the federal deficit to a projected $3.7 trillion for 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office, with three other coronavirus spending bills already passed and another, potentially $1 trillion-plus, piece of legislation being considered.\n\nCOUNTIES DEFYING STATE CORONAVIRUS 'STAY-AT-HOME' ORDERS AND REOPENING FOR BUSINESS\n\nPenn State Assistant Professor of Public Policy Simon Haeder, who specializes in health policy, noted some of the shortfalls -- and highlights -- in U.S. preparation for the coronavirus.\n\nHaeder specifically complimented the many highly trained and educated workers -- largely because of programs run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- available in the U.S. to plan responses, strong research capabilities at American universities and creative members of the private sector willing to respond to the public health crisis.\n\n\"I think we had good infrastructure in place, or we had people thinking about this, the CDC has good training programs, I think that was one of the benefits we had,\" he said. \"The CDC has a special training program that trains people and puts them back into the community as doctors, researchers and those kinds of things that are supposed to spot developments on the ground as they happen, and I think we are ahead of a lot of other countries when it comes to that.\"\n\nUnderscoring Haeder's point, the Global Health Security Index, which is put together by the Nuclear Threat Initiative -- an organization that works on both nuclear security and biosecurity -- ranked the U.S. as the most prepared of 195 countries ranked to deal with threats to its health security.\n\nBut, he said, as states begin to reopen their economies, the U.S. is not in a much better place than it was at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n\"A month ago or two months ago we didn't have a solution to the virus. We don't have any treatment that really works and we don't have any way to vaccinate people,\" Haeder said. \"Now we were able to withstand the initial onslaught of what was coming, but ... the same problem exists today. We don't have any treatment, and we don't have any vaccine. And the only thing we've done is we've not overwhelmed, in most places ... the health care system yet,\" by flattening the coronavirus curve with economic shutdowns.\n\nIt's a common misconception that business closures and stay-at-home orders aimed at \"flattening the curve\" are meant to reduce the total number of people who will fall ill because of the coronavirus. Rather, these curve-flattening measures are meant largely to reduce the number of people who are sick at any given time, thus avoiding a surge in cases that overwhelms the health care system and causes otherwise preventable deaths because not all patients are able to access lifesaving critical care.\n\nTREASURY TO BORROW $3T FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, ADDING MORE DEBT IN 1 QUARTER THAN ALL OF 2019\n\nOutside of a few hotspots, the U.S. has largely accomplished the goal. Most hospitals are not overwhelmed and the death rate from the coronavirus in the U.S. is either in line with or lower than that of other countries. But that has come with the drastic economic costs stemming from the large-scale shutdowns that made it possible.\n\nAccording to Haeder, despite what the government spent in the past decade to deal with health threats, it neglected to ensure there was a supply of medical means to keep the coronavirus from upending daily life in the way it has.\n\n\"We could keep more things open longer if our capacity to respond to this would have been higher,\" Haeder said. \"For sure, the curve that you're able to sustain medically is a lot higher if you're prepared.\"\n\nAchieving that capacity, Haeder said, would mean more concerted efforts to store things like ventilators and N95 masks, moving the production of many medical products back to the U.S. from India and China, and ensuring that U.S. industry has the ability to quickly ramp up the production of essential items when called upon.\n\nALARM BELLS SOUND OVER HISTORIC DEFICIT SPENDING, AS CORONAVIRUS BILLS COULD NEAR $5T\n\nThose measures, of course, would cost even more money. But Haeder says they would be worth it considering the United States' yearly health preparedness expenditures are dwarfed by the economic costs of responding to the crisis -- the CARES Act alone outsizes the government's yearly spending on health preparedness by a factor of about 200.\n\n\"We're hit with two things right now,\" he said. \"We're hit with the fallout from the medical issue of dealing with the virus, but it's made much, much worse from the economic side because the economic side will be with us for a very long time. There's a massive dip in income, lots of people lost their jobs. Lots of them will have lost their jobs permanently ... the debt has massively increased, and we could have dealt with a lot of that off-hand if we would have been better prepared.\"\n\nThe kind of efforts that would have allowed the U.S. to remain largely open, or at least more than it has, would be expensive, Haeder said. But he said \"no\" and laughed at the suggestion that their cost could approach $2.2 trillion.\n\n\"While I can't give you any numbers, I think you can make a sound case that spending just a little bit of money upfront is gonna be a really, really good investment,\" Haeder said, mentioning that there are ways, like rotating stocked-up supplies and selling them before they expire, to cut costs.\n\nHaeder also suggested that a lack of planning and organization on how governments and institutions coordinate their responses contributed to the severity of the pandemic in the U.S.\n\n\"When people got on Jared [Kushner]'s good side, they were able to get stuff. And, you know, when they could explain that they really needed it. I don't think that's a good way to handle a nationwide catastrophe, but I think we really need to think about how we put those lines of communication and lines of resources in place from a government-to-government perspective,\" Haeder said.\n\nMCCONNELL, SCHUMER SPAR OVER HEALTH OF LAWMAKERS AS SENATE CONVENES FOR FIRST TIME IN WEEKS\n\nSuch measures, involving more planning than spending money on tangible things, would also be a lot cheaper than economic stimulus after the fact. Trump critics often note that the Obama administration created a pandemic playbook and a council to prepare for and coordinate pandemic responses. The Trump administration eliminated the council and merged its responsibilities with other bodies during a reorganization of the National Security Council, and it did not use the playbook.\n\nOf course, there is rarely much appetite from lawmakers to funnel any amount of taxpayer money into preparing for invisible, undefined threats that may appear sometime in the future. There are other issues more palatable to voters -- like tax cuts, entitlement programs or infrastructure.\n\nCalls for increased health preparedness for future health crises have emerged in the wake of recent ones -- there are already people using the phrase \"never again\" about the coronavirus -- but if the current pandemic follows the same pattern as past health scares, those calls may die down eventually.\n\nAn example of this phenomenon can be found in New York City, which in 2006 under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg moved forward with an aggressive plan to prepare for a pandemic similar to the coronavirus.\n\nBut, in a story first reported by ProPublica, the city never purchased even half of the ventilators that it planned to. And those it did buy were eventually auctioned off because of the costs of maintaining and storing them, and the company that manufactured the ventilators stopped making the model the city bought.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe city also stocked up on N95 masks, but, the city's health department told ProPublica, they \"all expired, and it became cost-prohibitive to replace them in any meaningful quantity.\"\n\nDespite the costs and challenges, Haeder said, improving stockpiles of medical equipment and government planning would be a good investment for the next time a coronavirus-level pandemic hits.\n\n\"The argument that I'm making is if you're prepared, then your measures to deal with this don't have to be so draconian and ... we would have been able to keep more stuff open longer, and keep interaction to a degree up longer, and keep businesses open.\"",

WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hashailed China for the \"speed with which [it] detected the outbreak\" and its \"commitment to transparency\".\n\nUS President Donald Trump this week halted funding for the WHO, accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting China.\n\n\"Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?\" Mr Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has also questioned China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, saying it was \"naive\" to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis, adding things \"happened that we don't know about\".\n\nOn Thursday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: \"We'll have to ask the hard questions about how [coronavirus] came about and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier.\"",

        "date": "",
        "authors": "",
        "content": "US President Donald Trump has ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation 's food supply amid the coronavirus pandemic .\nHe invoked a Korean War-era law from the 1950s to mandate that the plants continue to function , amid industry warnings of strain on the supply chain .\nAn estimated 3,300 US meatpacking workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 20 have died .\nThe UN last month warned the emergency threatened global food supply chains .\nTwenty-two US meatpacking plants across the American Midwest have closed during the outbreak .\nThey include slaughterhouses owned by the nation 's biggest poultry , pork and beef producers , such as Smithfield Foods , Tyson Foods , Cargill and JBS USA .\n`` Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain , undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency , '' says Tuesday evening 's executive order , invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act .\n`` Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities , any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain . ''\nThe order designates the meatpacking plants as part of critical infrastructure in the US .\nA White House official told US media it will work with the Department of Labor to issue guidance for vulnerable workers , such as over-65s and those with chronic health conditions , to stay at home .\nThe leadership of large meatpacking companies have faced tough questions over whether they did enough to prepare for the pandemic and protect workers .\nOn top of the fact that production lines necessitate that workers stand very close together , most are low-income , hourly workers .\nMany are immigrants living paycheque to paycheque , like the ones at a Sioux Falls , South Dakota , pork plant who told the BBC that despite the risk , they have no choice but to go to work if plants are open .\nWithout strict adherence to safety guidelines - which are not currently being deemed `` mandatory '' by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - it 's not hard to picture new outbreaks at factories , or resurgences of the virus in factories that shuttered but reopen prematurely .\nAll of this could leave these employees trapped in the same impossible choice they were in when the virus first began spreading in factories in late March : risk my health or lose my job .\nJohn Tyson , chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page ads on Sunday in the Washington Post and New York Times to warn `` the nation 's food supply is breaking '' .\n`` As pork , beef and chicken plants are being forced to close , even for short periods of time , millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain , '' he wrote .\n`` As a result , there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed .

        "content_original": "Image copyright EPA Image caption Closures of meat processing plants quickly affect the food supply chain\n\nUS President Donald Trump has ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation's food supply amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe invoked a Korean War-era law from the 1950s to mandate that the plants continue to function, amid industry warnings of strain on the supply chain.\n\nAn estimated 3,300 US meatpacking workers have been diagnosed with coronavirus and 20 have died.\n\nThe UN last month warned the emergency threatened global food supply chains.\n\nTwenty-two US meatpacking plants across the American Midwest have closed during the outbreak.\n\nThey include slaughterhouses owned by the nation's biggest poultry, pork and beef producers, such as Smithfield Foods, Tyson Foods, Cargill and JBS USA.\n\nWhat does the White House say?\n\n\"Such closures threaten the continued functioning of the national meat and poultry supply chain, undermining critical infrastructure during the national emergency,\" says Tuesday evening's executive order, invoking the 1950 Defense Production Act.\n\n\"Given the high volume of meat and poultry processed by many facilities, any unnecessary closures can quickly have a large effect on the food supply chain.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: 'They risk their lives just to cut my hair'\n\nThe order designates the meatpacking plants as part of critical infrastructure in the US.\n\nA White House official told US media it will work with the Department of Labor to issue guidance for vulnerable workers, such as over-65s and those with chronic health conditions, to stay at home.\n\nLike lambs to the slaughter?\n\nAnalysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News\n\nThe leadership of large meatpacking companies have faced tough questions over whether they did enough to prepare for the pandemic and protect workers.\n\nOn top of the fact that production lines necessitate that workers stand very close together, most are low-income, hourly workers.\n\nMany are immigrants living paycheque to paycheque, like the ones at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, pork plant who told the BBC that despite the risk, they have no choice but to go to work if plants are open.\n\nWithout strict adherence to safety guidelines - which are not currently being deemed \"mandatory\" by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration - it's not hard to picture new outbreaks at factories, or resurgences of the virus in factories that shuttered but reopen prematurely.\n\nAll of this could leave these employees trapped in the same impossible choice they were in when the virus first began spreading in factories in late March: risk my health or lose my job.\n\nWhat does the meat industry say?\n\nJohn Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods took out full-page ads on Sunday in the Washington Post and New York Times to warn \"the nation's food supply is breaking\".\n\n\"As pork, beef and chicken plants are being forced to close, even for short periods of time, millions of pounds of meat will disappear from the supply chain,\" he wrote.\n\n\"As a result, there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we are able to reopen our facilities that are currently closed.\"\n\nHe said millions of cattle, pigs and chickens will be euthanised because of slaughterhouse closures, limiting supplies at supermarkets.\n\nPork production has borne the brunt, with daily output slashed by at least a quarter.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One thing that makes job loss in US so painful\n\nTyson - which employs some 100,000 workers nationwide - has suspended operations at its pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nSmithfield Foods shut down production at its plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after an outbreak infected hundreds of employees.\n\nWhat do the unions say?\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), the largest US meatpacking union, demanded the Trump administration compel meat companies to provide proper protective equipment and ensure daily coronavirus testing for slaughterhouse workers.\n\n\"While we share the concern over the food supply, today's executive order to force meatpacking plants to stay open must put the safety of our country's meatpacking workers first,\" said the union.\n\nThe UFCW said the White House order would provide legal cover to companies in case employees catch coronavirus at work.\n\n\"We're working with Tyson,\" Mr Trump told reporters in the Oval Office earlier on Tuesday. \"We're going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that will solve any liability problems.\"\n\nRichard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO union, said: \"Using executive power to force people back on the job without proper protections is wrong and dangerous.\"",

        "content": "( CNN ) Although the new coronavirus has been spreading through the United States for months , and there are cities seeing a flattening of the curve , some areas of the country have recently begun to find an uptick of cases .\nSome of these hot spots are in states that have just begun allowing businesses to reopen .\nIn Georgia , Gov . Brian Kemp said the state will open a temporary medical pod in cities such as Gainesville , about an hour northeast of Atlanta .\nGainesville is `` being stressed pretty hard ... at the moment , '' Kemp said Tuesday . The governor mentioned last week that while some areas of the state have seen reduced cases , Gainesville has an increase and area hospitals have had more hospitalizations .\nThe high number of daily hospitalizations for Covid-19 has continued this week .\nGainesville , with about 40,000 residents , is the county seat of Hall County , home to several poultry plants .\nKemp was in Albany on Tuesday , where another of the mobile units with about 20 beds was opening for non-Covid-19 patients . Speaking about the Gainesville pod , he said they 'll set it up but hope it 's not needed .\n`` But it 's going to be there in case we do .

        "content_original": "(CNN) Although the new coronavirus has been spreading through the United States for months, and there are cities seeing a flattening of the curve, some areas of the country have recently begun to find an uptick of cases.\n\nSome of these hot spots are in states that have just begun allowing businesses to reopen.\n\nIn Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp said the state will open a temporary medical pod in cities such as Gainesville, about an hour northeast of Atlanta.\n\nGainesville is \"being stressed pretty hard ... at the moment,\" Kemp said Tuesday. The governor mentioned last week that while some areas of the state have seen reduced cases, Gainesville has an increase and area hospitals have had more hospitalizations.\n\nThe high number of daily hospitalizations for Covid-19 has continued this week.\n\nGainesville, with about 40,000 residents, is the county seat of Hall County, home to several poultry plants.\n\nKemp was in Albany on Tuesday, where another of the mobile units with about 20 beds was opening for non-Covid-19 patients. Speaking about the Gainesville pod, he said they'll set it up but hope it's not needed.\n\n\"But it's going to be there in case we do. And that'll be a good regional spot, you know if something happens in Athens or anywhere across northeast Georgia, north Georgia,\" the governor said.\n\nAnother unit will be set up in Rome, Georgia, the governor said.\n\nAccording to data from Johns Hopkins University, 19 states are seeing an upward trend in new confirmed coronavirus cases over the past 14 days.

The new case marked the first in the U.S. that occurred via person-to-person transmission, CDC officials said.\n\nCommon symptoms of coronaviruses have resembled those of the common cold. Other strains of the virus such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and MERS could cause pneumonia and possible death.\n\nGhebreyesus applauded the Chinese government's \"speed\" in which it \"detected the outbreak, isolated the virus, sequenced the genome and shared it with WHO,\" and said China set \"a new standard for outbreak response.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe emphasized that the emergency declaration was not meant to \"unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,\" and \"doesn\u2019t recommend limiting trade and movement.\"\n\nGhebreyesus also urged all countries around the world to work together to support weaker health systems, develop and distribute vaccines and prevent transmission of the virus.",

        "content": "( CNN ) Sen. Bernie Sanders ended his presidential campaign on Wednesday , clearing Joe Biden 's path to the Democratic nomination and a showdown with President Donald Trump in November .\nSanders first made the announcement in a call with his staff , his campaign said .\n`` I wish I could give you better news , but I think you know the truth , and that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden , and the path toward victory is virtually impossible , '' Sanders said in a livestream after the call . `` So while we are winning the ideological battle and while we are winning the support of so many young people and working people throughout the country , I have concluded that this battle for the Democratic nomination will not be successful . And so today I am announcing the suspension of my campaign . ''\nSanders ' exit caps a stunning reversal of fortune following a strong performance in the first three states that voted in February . The nomination appeared his for the taking until , on the last day of February , Biden surged to a blowout victory in South Carolina that set off a consolidation of moderate voters around the former vice president . The contest ends now as the country continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic , which halted in-person campaigning for both Sanders and Biden and has led many states to delay their primary elections\nSanders said he did not make the decision lightly , describing it as a `` very difficult and painful decision . ''\n`` Over the past few weeks Jane and I , in consultation with top staff , and many of our prominent supporters , have made an honest assessment of the prospects for victory . If I believed we had a feasible path to the nomination , I would certainly continue the campaign . But it 's just not there , '' he said .\nSanders ' departure from the race is a sharp blow to progressives , who rose up during and after the 2016 campaign and commanded the Democratic Party 's Trump era debates over issues like health care , climate change and the effects of growing economic inequality .\n`` Few would deny that over the course of the past five years , our movement has won the ideological struggle , '' Sanders said on Wednesday . `` It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe . Today , they are mainstream ideas . Many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country . ''\nBut even as his policies grew more popular over the years and into the primary season , the Vermont senator struggled to broaden his own support and galvanize a winning coalition . Now , as he did after leaving the 2016 primary , Sanders will seek to influence the presumptive nominee through the means he knows best -- from the outside-in .\nBiden has already made gestures toward Sanders ' populist base , which formed a movement over the past five years that could be critical to defeating Trump in the fall . Whether the former vice president will take the necessary steps to win over the holdouts , and the extent to which Sanders goes to make the case , will be a running subplot until Election Day . Sanders ' decision to remain on the primary ballot in order to amass `` as many delegates as possible '' as part of an effort , he said , `` to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions '' at this summer 's convention underscores the depth of the divisions both he and Biden still have to bridge .\nSanders and Biden spoke Wednesday morning , with the Vermont senator telling the former vice president about his decision to end his presidential campaign , according to people familiar with the call .\nIn a statement after Sanders ' announcement , Biden called the senator a `` powerful voice for a fairer and more just America '' and said his campaign 's impact on the election is far from over . He also made an explicit call for Sanders ' supporters to join him .\n`` And to ( Sanders ' ) supporters I make the same commitment : I see you , I hear you , and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country . I hope you will join us . You are more than welcome . You 're needed , '' Biden said . ''\nSanders also acknowledged on Wednesday that some of his supporters would be disappointed by his exit .\n`` I know that there may be some in our movement who disagree with this decision , who would like us to fight on until the last ballot cast at the Democratic convention . I understand that position , '' he said . `` But as I see the crisis gripping the nation , exacerbated by a President unwilling or unable to provide any kind of credible leadership , and the work that needs to be done to protect people in this most desperate hour , I can not in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that can not win , and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour . ''\nThe pivot from four- and five-event days came abruptly last month as Americans attempted to combat the coronavirus by staying , sometimes on state and local leaders ' order , inside their homes .\nThe Sanders campaign held its final live public event on March 9 , transitioning from packed , raucous rallies to an entirely digital operation . He communicated almost exclusively through virtual town halls and livestreams focused on the coronavirus crisis -- and how his progressive agenda , headlined by `` Medicare for All , '' might have prevented it or helped cushion the blow .\nIt was a point he returned to on Wednesday morning .\n`` This current , horrific crisis we are now in has exposed for all to see how absurd our current , employer-based health insurance system is , '' Sanders said . `` The current economic downturn we are experiencing has not only led to a massive loss of jobs but has also resulted in millions of Americans losing their health insurance . ''\nEven in the end , the message remained the same . For Sanders ' supporters , though , the context was jarring .\nLess than two months ago , the Vermont senator appeared poised to run away with the nomination after a strong performance in Iowa and victories in New Hampshire and Nevada , the latter by more than 25 percentage points , on the strength of his popularity with Latino voters , which had been courted relentlessly by his campaign .\nBut Sanders ' momentum was dashed in South Carolina . Biden routed the field and then cleared it . The anti-Sanders vote rallied around him and , even with Sanders ' win in California , put Biden in the driver 's seat on Super Tuesday .\nThe wind at his back , the former vice president duplicated the feat a week later , delivering the hammer blow in Michigan , a state Sanders won in 2016 and viewed as crucial to his prospects in 2020 . A day earlier , public safety measures in response to the coronavirus effectively ended the campaign roadshow .\nSanders would return to Vermont , where he has spent most of his time since , while Biden set up headquarters at home in Delaware . The Sanders fundraising machine , the most successful grassroots donor effort in American political history , was over the last month re-purposed into a feeder for public health groups .\nSanders addresses supporters during a campaign rally on March 8 , 2020 in Ann Arbor , Michigan .\nSanders entered the race in February 2019 as an early frontrunner . In an email announcing his second run for the presidency , he asked voters to `` join me today as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country . ''\nHe would quickly hit and surpass that goal and raise , throughout the campaign , more money from small dollar donors than any candidate in American political history .\nHis status atop the early polls , before Biden got in the contest and claimed the lead , underscored the power Sanders had built up since beginning his first presidential campaign as a little-known lawmaker from Vermont who freely called himself a democratic socialist .\nBy the end of the 2016 race , Sanders emerged as one of the most influential figures in Democratic politics . His policy agenda -- a suite of progressive proposals including Medicare for All , tuition free public college and the Green New Deal -- set the terms of debate among the 2020 candidates .\nDespite entering with a head start on the field , Sanders ' second campaign encountered some early headwinds as Democratic voters sampled a diverse array of candidates , many of them offering pieces of the progressive vision that Sanders popularized . By the late summer , Sanders appeared to be falling behind fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren , his Senate colleague from Massachusetts .\nA campaign on its heels would be knocked to the pavement in early October , when Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada .\nBut what many supporters and staff feared would be the end turned out to be a springboard . Sanders recovered quickly and , before leaving Las Vegas , received a call from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nThe young , progressive star , who had been intensely courted by Warren , told Sanders she was endorsing him . Her early events for Sanders in Iowa were electric , but as the primary heated up , her appearances become fewer and further in between -- an early sign of the tactical tensions that would face the left in the coming months .\nStill , for a campaign that had scuffled through the summer and into the fall , it felt -- at least for that moment in mid-October moment -- as if a switch had been flipped .\nSanders returned to the trail only a couple weeks after falling ill and , after turning in a sterling debate performance in Ohio on October 15 , began to climb in the polls .\nDays later , in a packed riverside park in Queens , New York , after being introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and taking the stage to AC/DC 's `` Back in Black , '' Sanders addressed one of his largest and most diverse audiences of the campaign .\n`` Take a look around you and find someone you do n't know . Maybe somebody that does n't look kinda like you , maybe somebody who might be of a different religion than you , maybe they come from a different country , '' he said .\nAides who had driven and flown in from around the country looked on , rapt like his supporters , some of them watching from across the streets after the park hit its capacity .\n`` My question now to you is are you willing to fight for that person , who you do n't even know , '' Sanders said , `` as much as you 're willing to fight for yourself ? ''\nThe question -- and the call -- would be a centerpiece of his campaign in the weeks and months that followed .\nOcasio-Cortez , who looked on as he said those words , tweeted in praise of Sanders after the decision was made public .\n`` Thank you Bernie - for doing your best to fight for all of us , from the beginning , for your entire life , '' she wrote . `` Thank you for fighting hard , lonely fights in true devotion to a people 's movement in the United States . Thank you for your leadership , mentorship , and example . We love you . ''\nSupporters of Democratic presidential hopeful Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cheer during a rally at Houston University in Houston , Texas on February 23 , 2020 .\nAs Biden , in the aftermath of South Carolina , lined up support and endorsements from moderates across the board , Sanders was unable to do the same with the progressive wing of the party . Warren , buoyed by the late-arriving support of a super PAC , stayed in the race through Super Tuesday .\nShe dropped out the following Thursday , but despite being so closely aligned with Sanders on policy , chose to stay on the sidelines instead of putting her support behind his struggling campaign . Though some Sanders ' supporters lashed out at Warren for not immediately backing him , the writing had been on the wall .\nThe pair had been close , as political figures go , though they took fundamentally different views of how to win and exert power . But the controversy over whether Sanders told Warren in late 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency -- which she confirmed and he denied -- cut off meaningful communications between the campaigns .\nIn the end , and as many on both sides acknowledged privately at the time , it was already too late .\nWarren on Wednesday tweeted in praise of Sanders and the impact of his two presidential campaigns .\n`` Your fight for progressive ideas moved the conversation and charted a path for candidates and activists that will change the course of our country and party , '' she wrote .\nAfter losing five of the six contests on March 10 , including Michigan , and all three primaries on March 17 , Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir signaled the beginning of the end . Sanders , he said in a statement , `` is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign , '' but that `` in the immediate term , however , he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak . ''\nSanders batted away questions about the future of his campaign through the latter half of March , as his campaign -- with the exception of a handful of combative surrogates and staff who continued to batter Biden -- largely retrained its focus on the coronavirus .\nAsked about his plans during a recent visit to Capitol Hill , Sanders bristled , telling CNN , `` I 'm dealing with a f * * king global crisis . '' By then , his livestream conversations and other campaign-adjacent online events rarely made mention of the primary or Biden .\nAs Sanders started to make more television appearances after leaving Washington , he became increasingly frank about his chances of winning the nomination .\n`` There is a path , it is admittedly a narrow path , '' Sanders told `` Late Night '' host Seth Meyers last week .\nBut those acknowledgments were mixed in with public arguments for staying in the race -- and other remarks , more difficult to discern , that offered some insight into Sanders ' own indecision .\n`` I mean , right now , under normal times , I would n't be talking to you from my home '' Sanders told CNN 's Anderson Cooper in an interview on Friday . `` So yes , the calculus has absolutely changed . And you know , we 're talking to a lot of people , and trying to figure out the best way forward . ''\nToward the end , the questions often appeared to shape the answers . After being pressed by Whoopi Goldberg on `` The View '' last week over his reasons for remaining in the race , Sanders sounded like he was settling in for a longer haul .\n`` Last I heard , people in a democracy have a right to vote , '' he said , `` and they have a right to vote for the agenda that they think can work for America . ''\nBut in his livestream events , conducted with top aides , advisers and friends , Sanders was more expansive .\nThe pandemic , he argued , had pulled the tide out and revealed in the starkest ways possible the ugliest inequities in American life .\n`` I think it is not inappropriate to be trying to ask ourselves , how did we get to where we are today , and maybe where we want to go when all this is behind us , '' Sanders said on April 4 . `` And I think some of the questions that we have to ask ourselves , and you have heard me say this a million times , is how does it happen that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right ? ''\nHe spoke with former President Barack Obama in the last few weeks as he determined the future of his campaign , a source familiar with the conversation tells CNN .\nObama , throughout the 2020 Democratic primary , had regular conversations with candidates , including before , during and after their respective bids .\n`` His private counsel consistently emphasized staying focused on the ultimate goal : Winning the White House in November , '' the source familiar with Obama 's calls tells CNN . `` He was impressed by the caliber of our candidates and the strong campaigns they waged -- but always urged them to keep in mind that we must be well-positioned to unify as a Party once we have a nominee . ''\nFive years after Sanders launched a message campaign with the hope of rejuvenating progressive grassroots and keep Hillary Clinton accountable to the Democratic Party 's left flank , and after that bid touched off a movement that has spawned a new generation of leftist leaders , Sanders by the end of his 2020 race had , in many ways , returned to his own beginnings .\nWhether Sanders ' decision to the leave the contest now , rather than carrying on as he did in 2016 through the end of the primary calendar , will earn him some goodwill with the party establishment he fought so long and hard to upend , is an open question . An earlier departure wo n't blot out the ideological divisions that have roiled the party since 2016 .\nBut the more immediate question facing Sanders , following his departure , and his supporters is whether and to what extent they will lend their support -- and organizing energy -- to Biden 's campaign .\nSanders has been insistent that he would support the eventual nominee , no matter who it was . But his political base -- especially the young , who voted for him by overwhelming margins , and disaffected -- will be more difficult to bring along , no matter how many miles Sanders covers on Biden 's behalf .",

After being pressed by Whoopi Goldberg on \"The View\" last week over his reasons for remaining in the race, Sanders sounded like he was settling in for a longer haul.\n\n\"Last I heard, people in a democracy have a right to vote,\" he said, \"and they have a right to vote for the agenda that they think can work for America.\"\n\nBut in his livestream events, conducted with top aides, advisers and friends, Sanders was more expansive.\n\nThe pandemic, he argued, had pulled the tide out and revealed in the starkest ways possible the ugliest inequities in American life.\n\n\"I think it is not inappropriate to be trying to ask ourselves, how did we get to where we are today, and maybe where we want to go when all this is behind us,\" Sanders said on April 4. \"And I think some of the questions that we have to ask ourselves, and you have heard me say this a million times, is how does it happen that we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right?\"\n\nHe spoke with former President Barack Obama in the last few weeks as he determined the future of his campaign, a source familiar with the conversation tells CNN.\n\nObama, throughout the 2020 Democratic primary, had regular conversations with candidates, including before, during and after their respective bids.\n\n\"His private counsel consistently emphasized staying focused on the ultimate goal: Winning the White House in November,\" the source familiar with Obama's calls tells CNN. \"He was impressed by the caliber of our candidates and the strong campaigns they waged -- but always urged them to keep in mind that we must be well-positioned to unify as a Party once we have a nominee.\"\n\nFive years after Sanders launched a message campaign with the hope of rejuvenating progressive grassroots and keep Hillary Clinton accountable to the Democratic Party's left flank, and after that bid touched off a movement that has spawned a new generation of leftist leaders, Sanders by the end of his 2020 race had, in many ways, returned to his own beginnings.\n\nWhether Sanders' decision to the leave the contest now, rather than carrying on as he did in 2016 through the end of the primary calendar, will earn him some goodwill with the party establishment he fought so long and hard to upend, is an open question. An earlier departure won't blot out the ideological divisions that have roiled the party since 2016.\n\nBut the more immediate question facing Sanders, following his departure, and his supporters is whether and to what extent they will lend their support -- and organizing energy -- to Biden's campaign.\n\nSanders has been insistent that he would support the eventual nominee, no matter who it was. But his political base -- especially the young, who voted for him by overwhelming margins, and disaffected -- will be more difficult to bring along, no matter how many miles Sanders covers on Biden's behalf.\n\nThis story has been updated.",
