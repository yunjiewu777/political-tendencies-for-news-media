He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was `` vital '' to stem the flow of illegal immigrants .\nHe said that , if it came to it , he would risk a government shutdown - which is what happens when legislation funding the federal government can not be passed by Congress and non-essential services stop .\n`` Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it , but believe me if we have to close down our government , we are building that wall , '' Mr Trump said , adding that `` the American people voted for immigration control '' .\nIf President Trump wants a government shutdown all he has to do is refuse to sign a funding bill sent to him by Congress .\nCapitol Hill is set to debate a new budget measure this autumn , and unless it is passed federal operations will be in limbo by 1 October .\nDonald Trump 's signature campaign promise - to `` build that wall '' - epitomised his appeal to the nation , an apparently simple solution to a problem freighted with racial and economic undertones .\nNot only that but it would be free !

'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence .

He said that Joe Arpaio - who was found guilty of criminal contempt in July over his detention of migrants - `` is going to be just fine '' , but he would not yet formally pardon him because `` I do n't want to cause any controversy ''\nResponding to the speech , the former National Intelligence director James Clapper told CNN that he was questioning Donald Trump 's `` fitness '' for office .\n`` I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it , '' he said , adding he found the rally `` downright scary and disturbing '' .\nRuben Gallego , a Democratic Party congressman in Arizona , said it was the worst-ever speech by a US president . `` It was all about him , it was not about the country , '' he told the BBC .\nA former British ambassador to the US , Peter Westmacott , said he saw parallels with the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933 .\n`` President Trump did an amazing job tonight .

He said immigration officers who worked in the area said it was \"vital\" to stem the flow of illegal immigrants.\n\nHe said that, if it came to it, he would risk a government shutdown - which is what happens when legislation funding the federal government cannot be passed by Congress and non-essential services stop.\n\n\"Now the obstructionist Democrats would like us not to do it, but believe me if we have to close down our government, we are building that wall,\" Mr Trump said, adding that \"the American people voted for immigration control\".\n\nIf President Trump wants a government shutdown all he has to do is refuse to sign a funding bill sent to him by Congress.\n\nCapitol Hill is set to debate a new budget measure this autumn, and unless it is passed federal operations will be in limbo by 1 October.\n\nTrump's 'all or nothing' approach\n\nBy James Cook, BBC North America correspondent, Phoenix\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The president is struggling to realise his central campaign pledge to build a wall on the Mexican border\n\nDonald Trump's signature campaign promise - to \"build that wall\" - epitomised his appeal to the nation, an apparently simple solution to a problem freighted with racial and economic undertones.\n\nNot only that but it would be free! Mexico would pay, as Mr Trump and his cheering crowds repeatedly insisted.\n\nBut it turns out that governing is harder than campaigning.\n\nConstruction of prototypes near San Diego in California - which had been scheduled for this summer - has been delayed until at least December by a legal challenge from one rejected bidder.\n\nRanchers, environmentalists and some businesses on the border have raised objections to the plan, while one Republican congressman in Texas, Will Hurd, has even described the wall as the most expensive and least effective way to secure the border.\n\nMexico, needless to say, is not keen to write a cheque.\n\nFaced with the need to win over doubters on the detail, and explain why this would be a lot of money well spent, Mr Trump has instead chosen to raise the stakes with an \"all or nothing\" approach.\n\nThis should not come as a surprise.\n\nWhat did he say about Charlottesville?\n\nPresident Trump attacked the media in the campaign-style speech, saying reporters had misrepresented his \"perfect\" words in the wake of the violence in Charlottesville, where Heather Heyer was killed after a car ploughed into a crowd of people protesting against far-right demonstrators including neo-Nazis.\n\nHe accused \"truly dishonest people in the media and the fake media\" of \"trying to take away our history and heritage\" because, he said, they \"don't like our country\".\n\nHe quoted his first public response to the violence on 12 August, which was criticised by both Republicans and Democrats for not explicitly condemning the far-right.\n\n\"This is what I said on Saturday: 'We're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia,' - this is me speaking. 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence.' That's me speaking on Saturday, right after the event,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Police pepper spray protesters outside the Trump rally\n\nBut his full quote was: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\"\n\nSeparately, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has criticised the US for what it said was a \"failure at the highest political level\" to reject \"racist violent events\".\n\nReferring to Charlottesville, the committee said it was issuing a rare \"early warning\", which has been used in recent years in countries including Burundi, Iraq, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast.\n\nWhat other topics came up?\n\nNafta: The US, Mexico and Canada have begun talks on revising their trade deal, and negotiators are due to meet again on 1 September. But Mr Trump said he thought he would \"probably end up terminating Nafta\"\n\nThe US, Mexico and Canada have begun talks on revising their trade deal, and negotiators are due to meet again on 1 September. But Mr Trump said he thought he would \"probably end up terminating Nafta\" North Korea: He sounded hopeful about a reduction in tensions. Referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump said: \"I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us.\" He added: \"And maybe - probably not, but maybe - something positive can come about\"\n\nHe sounded hopeful about a reduction in tensions. Referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Mr Trump said: \"I respect the fact that he is starting to respect us.\" He added: \"And maybe - probably not, but maybe - something positive can come about\" Sheriff Joe Arpaio: The US president hinted he would pardon the controversial former Arizona sheriff, who rose to national prominence because of his tough stance against illegal immigration. He said that Joe Arpaio - who was found guilty of criminal contempt in July over his detention of migrants - \"is going to be just fine\", but he would not yet formally pardon him because \"I don't want to cause any controversy\"\n\nWhat has the reaction been?\n\nResponding to the speech, the former National Intelligence director James Clapper told CNN that he was questioning Donald Trump's \"fitness\" for office.\n\n\"I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it,\" he said, adding he found the rally \"downright scary and disturbing\".\n\nRuben Gallego, a Democratic Party congressman in Arizona, said it was the worst-ever speech by a US president. \"It was all about him, it was not about the country,\" he told the BBC.\n\nA former British ambassador to the US, Peter Westmacott, said he saw parallels with the establishment of Nazi Germany in 1933.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters hold up an inflatable Joe Arpaio, whom Mr Trump hinted he would pardon\n\nBut Trump supporters were pleased.\n\n\"President Trump did an amazing job tonight. His message is uniting our great nation!\", tweeted Ryan Fournier, the head of Students for Trump.\n\nWhite Nationalist Richard Spencer tweeted: \"Trump has never denounced the Alt-Right. Nor will he.\"\n\nWas the rally peaceful?\n\nWhile Mr Trump's comments were met with cheers inside the conference centre, anti-Trump protesters who had gathered outside the rally clashed with police after the rally had finished.\n\nA police spokesman in the city said at least four arrests were made after protesters threw bottles and rocks.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning",

Ultimately it will be the nine justices of the Supreme Court who will decide where legitimate authority ends and overreach begins.\n\nEarlier on Thursday Mr Trump called Democrats \"border deniers\" and said any Republican opposing him would be casting \"a vote for Nancy Pelosi\".\n\nHe says the barrier is needed to combat illegal immigration on the southern border which he has described as a \"crisis\".\n\nDemocrats say the declaration is unconstitutional, Mr Trump has manufactured the border emergency and a wall would be a boondoggle.\n\nThe resolution to revoke the declaration passed the House by a margin of 245-182 in February. Thirteen Republicans sided with Democrats.\n\nLawmakers used a provision from the National Emergencies Act to overrule the president.\n\nMost Republicans supported Mr Trump's decision and accused Democrats of ignoring an emergency at the border.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the declaration is \"the predictable and understandable consequences of Democrats' decision to put partisan obstruction ahead of the national interest\".\n\nWhat did the rebel Republicans say?\n\nThe renegade conservatives largely condemned Mr Trump's declaration for setting up a dangerous presidential precedent while still agreeing with his border policies.\n\n\"This issue is not about strengthening our border security, a goal that I support and have voted to advance,\" Mrs Collins said ahead of the vote.\n\n\"It is a solemn occasion involving whether or not this body will stand up for its institutional prerogatives and will support the separation of powers enshrined in our constitution.\"\n\nMr Paul agreed Congress must fund border security, \"but no president should go around Congress\".\n\nHe added that if the declaration stands, it could allow a future \"socialist-inclined president\" to pass environmental or gun control legislation.\n\nMr Romney echoed a similar sentiment, calling the use of an emergency an \"overreach\" that \"is an invitation to further expansion and abuse by future presidents\".",

No one has made the case against the course of action Obama is taking better than the former constitutional law professor who now sits in the Oval Office.\n\nUnder pressure for years by Hispanic supporters to stem deportations, the president has repeatedly complained that he cannot just wave a magic wand and make things right.\n\n\"This notion that somehow, I can just change the laws unilaterally is not true .... The fact of the matter is there are laws on the books that I have to enforce,\" he said in 2011.\n\nObama has pointed out that he is not a \"king\" or an \"emperor\" \u2014 words now being used against him by opponents and spooling on a loop on television channels.\n\n\"Our president has a preternatural ability to stay one thing and then do another,\" Texas Republican Sen.

He said, 'You bet,'\" Bush said of Obama's daughters, Sasha and Malia, who accompanied first lady Michelle Obama and the president on the trip.\n\n\"I remember bringing our daughters on some of these trips, and how meaningful it was to be with them,\" Bush said, adding that there was no talk of policy.\n\nCNN's Paul Steinhauser, Ashley Killough and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.",

        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The Trump administration is releasing its plan for putting back together the thousands of families it separated at the border -- but the reunions wo n't happen quickly .\nIn a release Saturday night , the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services said 2,053 children were still in the custody of HHS and awaiting being returned to their parents .\nUnder the plan , however , those children will keep waiting in custody , with reunifications only happening once the parents ' deportation proceedings are completed . The families will either be reunited before deportation or , if the parent is released from detention , after the parent applies to serve as the child 's sponsor under HHS rules .\nAs part of the reunification effort , the government is building out better organized databases linking the parent and children 's information and whereabouts and working to better facilitate communication between them , the fact sheet said .\nThe guidance came days after President Donald Trump abruptly reversed course on his administration 's decision to refer all adults caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution , including those with children -- a decision that resulted in more 2,500 children being taken away from their parents in the almost two months it was in place .\nDHS said that 522 had been reunited since the policy began , with 16 more reunions in process delayed due to weather .\nBut Trump 's executive order on Wednesday telling his administration to keep families together only added to the confusion at first -- as the order seemed impossible to actually put in place . In the wake of the order , guidance obtained by CNN showed that the US Border Patrol would stop referring parents for prosecution until further notice .\nThe move follows days of fallout caused by the President 's reversal , which happened suddenly . Thursday into Friday , officials across the administration huddled intensely within agencies and across agencies trying to work out how , exactly , the order would be implemented .\nOn Friday , DHS had already reunited any children that were still in its custody with their parents -- a smaller group that had likely been separated within the last three days and had yet to be transferred to HHS care . But the future of the thousands already affected remained in limbo .\nUnder the plan , children will be reunited with their parents based on the result of their parents ' immigration proceedings . In the meantime , parents will continue to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement pending an immigration judge 's decision on their right to stay in the US , and the children will remain with HHS . Keeping the adult detained means their immigration court case moves more quickly .\nIf a judge decides that the immigrant may have a claim to pursue and the immigrant is deemed eligible for release , the parent can apply as a sponsor for their child in HHS custody . This is required by law once the child is in HHS custody , and the sponsorship application process can take weeks , though it 's unclear whether the parent can start that process before they are released from detention .\nIf a judge decides that the adult is eligible for deportation , the child will be reunited with the parent prior their deportation from the country .\nIn its release , DHS noted that it is the parents ' choice whether to be deported with their child , and that `` in the past many parents have elected to be removed without their children .

        "content_original": "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is releasing its plan for putting back together the thousands of families it separated at the border -- but the reunions won't happen quickly.\n\nIn a release Saturday night, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services said 2,053 children were still in the custody of HHS and awaiting being returned to their parents.\n\nUnder the plan, however, those children will keep waiting in custody, with reunifications only happening once the parents' deportation proceedings are completed. The families will either be reunited before deportation or, if the parent is released from detention, after the parent applies to serve as the child's sponsor under HHS rules.\n\nAs part of the reunification effort, the government is building out better organized databases linking the parent and children's information and whereabouts and working to better facilitate communication between them, the fact sheet said.\n\nThe guidance came days after President Donald Trump abruptly reversed course on his administration's decision to refer all adults caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, including those with children -- a decision that resulted in more 2,500 children being taken away from their parents in the almost two months it was in place.\n\nDHS said that 522 had been reunited since the policy began, with 16 more reunions in process delayed due to weather.\n\nBut Trump's executive order on Wednesday telling his administration to keep families together only added to the confusion at first -- as the order seemed impossible to actually put in place. In the wake of the order, guidance obtained by CNN showed that the US Border Patrol would stop referring parents for prosecution until further notice.\n\nThe move follows days of fallout caused by the President's reversal, which happened suddenly. Thursday into Friday, officials across the administration huddled intensely within agencies and across agencies trying to work out how, exactly, the order would be implemented.\n\nOn Friday, DHS had already reunited any children that were still in its custody with their parents -- a smaller group that had likely been separated within the last three days and had yet to be transferred to HHS care. But the future of the thousands already affected remained in limbo.\n\nUnder the plan, children will be reunited with their parents based on the result of their parents' immigration proceedings. In the meantime, parents will continue to be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement pending an immigration judge's decision on their right to stay in the US, and the children will remain with HHS. Keeping the adult detained means their immigration court case moves more quickly.\n\nIf a judge decides that the immigrant may have a claim to pursue and the immigrant is deemed eligible for release, the parent can apply as a sponsor for their child in HHS custody. This is required by law once the child is in HHS custody, and the sponsorship application process can take weeks, though it's unclear whether the parent can start that process before they are released from detention.\n\nIf a judge decides that the adult is eligible for deportation, the child will be reunited with the parent prior their deportation from the country.\n\nIn its release, DHS noted that it is the parents' choice whether to be deported with their child, and that \"in the past many parents have elected to be removed without their children.\"\n\nIt's still unclear who will take responsibility for linking parents with children.\n\nPolicies to date have put the onus on parents to track their children down using an HHS hotline, which parents and the lawyers and case workers working with them described as confusing and often ineffective. The fact sheet says ICE and HHS will work to facilitate communication, but still lists numbers that parents should call for assistance.\n\nWhen the prosecution policy went into effect, HHS became the natural place for the children separated from their parents, as under existing laws the agency cares for undocumented minors who enter the country illegally by themselves.\n\nChildren in the system\n\nBut to hand the children over, they were essentially redefined as unaccompanied migrant children -- subjecting them to the same HHS procedures as children who entered alone.\n\nThat meant that their cases, tracking information and the agency that was caring for them was completely separate from the organization caring for their parents -- and no planning appeared to have gone into how the families would be reunited.\n\nIn recent days, ICE has been standing up its new reunification center at Port Isabel Service Processing Center in Texas, but the focus of that center is reuniting parents who are ready to be deported back to their home countries.\n\nThough criminal charges for the misdemeanor offense of crossing the border illegally take only a few days to resolve and the immigrants are usually only sentenced to time served, by the time parents emerged from Department of Justice custody, their children had already been sent to shelters elsewhere in the country.\n\nParents and their representatives have been left struggling to find out where the children went, and because of secretive procedures protecting children in government custody due to privacy concerns, there is no straightforward way to look up a child in the system. Parents have been given hotline numbers to call that users describe as byzantine and hard to get through.\n\nAlso, once children are in HHS custody, procedures require that they be released to someone who qualifies as a \"sponsor\" under the agency's policies, which would almost certainly exclude an adult in DHS detention facilities, meaning parents can't be reunited until the government decides to release them or deport them.\n\nNone of the agencies involved in the process have been designated as the central keeper of both parents' and children's data with the responsibility of putting them back together at the end.\n\nThe process to find one's child is \"incredibly challenging, and what I fear is that it might, in some cases, be impossible,\" said Wendy Young, president of the advocacy and legal support organization Kids in Need of Defense and an immigration policy expert.",

I think there is commitment among this group of Democratic and Republican senators to get this done , '' he said .\nWhen the reporters from Telemundo and Univision both noted that many Latin American governments do not feel like they 're a priority for the Obama administration , the president described his upcoming trip .\n`` I 'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit Mexico .

I think there is commitment among this group of Democratic and Republican senators to get this done,\" he said.\n\nWhen the reporters from Telemundo and Univision both noted that many Latin American governments do not feel like they're a priority for the Obama administration, the president described his upcoming trip.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to visit Mexico. I'm going to be there in early May,\" Obama told Telemundo. \"Sometimes the relationship gets characterized as being just about borders or just about drug cartels. There is so much more in terms of commerce, trade and energy.\"",

        "content": "Washington ( CNN ) US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Monday that bans immigration from six Muslim-majority countries , dropping Iraq from January 's previous order , and reinstates a temporary blanket ban on all refugees .\nThe new travel ban comes six weeks after Trump 's original executive order caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts . It removes out language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries . That provision drew criticism of a religious test for entry and would have prioritized Christians over Muslims fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East .\nThe new ban , which takes effect March 16 , also explicitly exempts citizens of the six banned countries who are legal US permanent residents or have valid visas to enter the US -- including those whose visas were revoked during the original implementation of the ban , senior administration officials said .\n`` We can not compromise our nation 's security by allowing visitors entry when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide the information we need to vet them responsibly , or when those governments actively support terrorism , '' Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Monday .\nThe new measures will block citizens of Syria , Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days . The order also suspends admission of refugees into the US for 120 days , directing US officials to improve vetting measures for a program that is already widely regarded as extremely stringent .\nTrump signed the executive order earlier Monday in the Oval Office outside the view of reporters and news cameras , after more than three weeks of repeated delays , the latest of which came after White House officials decided last week to delay the signing to avoid cutting into positive coverage of Trump 's joint address to Congress .\nThe delays also came amid an intense lobbying effort from Iraqi government officials , including from the country 's prime minister , to remove Iraq from the original seven-state list of banned countries .\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said Iraq 's removal from the list came after an intense review from the State Department to improve vetting of Iraqi citizens in collaboration with the Iraqi government , though he did not specify how vetting had been improved .\n`` The United States welcomes this kind of close cooperation , '' he said . `` This revised order will bolster the security of the United States and our allies . ''\nThe rollout of the revised travel ban marks an important moment for the administration , which has little room for error after the chaotic debut of the original plan . That failure raised questions about the new White House 's capacity to govern and to master the political intricacies needed to manage complicated political endeavors in Washington . It also brought Trump into conflict with the judiciary in the first sign of how constitutional checks and balances could challenge his vision of a powerful presidency built on expansive executive authority .\nThe original order came under intense criticism as an attempt to bar Muslims from entering the country , and Trump 's call during the campaign for a `` Muslim Ban '' was cited in court cases attacking the ban .\nThe new order does not prioritize religious minorities when considering refugee admissions cases .\nAdministration officials Monday stressed they do not see the ban as targeting a specific religion .\n`` ( The order is ) not any way targeted as a Muslim ban ... we want to make sure everyone understands that , '' an official told reporters .\n`` The Department of Justice believes that this executive order just as the first executive order is a lawful and proper exercise of presidential authority , '' Sessions said .\nDemocrats responded by calling Trump 's order a repeat version of the first attempt .\n`` Here we go again ... Muslim Ban 2.0 # NoBanNoWall '' tweeted Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana , one of two Muslims serving in the House of Representatives .\nThe newly crafted order also revealed that the administration was n't just paying attention to the legal criticism in the courts , but also recalibrating in light of the heavy political fire they faced after the first order 's messy rollout .\nWhile administration lawyers argued the original travel ban went into effect immediately to prevent terrorists from rushing into the country , the revised ban will phase in after 10 days . The previous order will be rescinded on that date .\nTrump had previously said he opposed giving any advance notice of the ban .\n`` If the ban were announced with a one week notice , the `` bad '' would rush into our country during that week . A lot of bad `` dudes '' out there ! '' he tweeted on January 30\nThe White House also abandoned the sense of urgency with which it implemented the first travel ban , delaying the signing of a new executive order multiple times over the last three weeks . Politics also came into play as White House officials delayed the signing from last Wednesday in part to allow positive coverage of the President 's joint address to Congress to continue uninterrupted .\n`` We want the ( executive order ) to have its own 'moment , ' '' a senior administration official told CNN last week .\nThe President signed the action Monday morning without the fanfare he has given to other executive orders . No media was present during the signing at the White House , an administration official confirmed . White House spokesman Sean Spicer tweeted a picture of Trump signing the order .\nWhite House officials collaborated for several weeks with officials at the Department of Homeland Security , the Justice Department and kept congressional leaders apprised of their progress this time around after the White House drew a backlash for keeping Congress and relevant federal agencies almost entirely in the dark during the first rollout .\nTo bolster its national security claims , the new executive order also states FBI has reported that approximately 300 people who entered the United States as refugees are `` currently the subjects of counter-terrorism investigations . ''\n`` The fact remains that we are not immune to terrorist threats and that our enemies often use our own freedoms and generosity against us , '' Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said . `` We can not risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives . ''\nRep. Adam Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee , said the ban `` has the same fundamental flaws '' as the first order .\n`` We know that country of origin is a poor predictor of a propensity to commit acts of terror . If it were , Pakistan has been a far more problematic source of attack planning and would be at the top of the President 's list , but that country merits not even a mention in the order , '' Schiff said in a statement .\nBut the new order was also delayed in part because of a debate within the administration over how to handle Iraq .\nTillerson , Secretary of Defense James Mattis and national security adviser Gen. H.R . McMaster had all advocated for Iraq to be removed from the Trump administration 's list of banned countries in the new executive order for diplomatic reasons , including Iraq 's role in fighting ISIS , sources told CNN 's Elise Labott and Evan Perez . Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also supported the move .\nIraq was removed from the revised travel ban executive order after intensive lobbying from the Iraqi government at the highest levels , according to a senior US official .\nThat included a phone call between Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on February 10 and an in-person conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18 .\nThose conversations were followed by discussions between Tillerson and members of the Iraqi government about vetting measures in place that would prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and coming to the United States . Iraq did not implement new measures ; rather , the country provided more detail to US officials about how it screens travelers .\nIn Trump 's call with Abadi , the President vowed to seek a resolution to his counterpart 's concerns about his citizens ' being unable to enter the United States , according to a readout of the phone call from Baghdad . The US official said Trump asked Tillerson to get greater clarity on vetting measures in Iraq .\nTrump also faced pressure to remove Iraq from the order from some American national security officials , who argued the restriction burdened a key anti-ISIS partner . Some of those voices were holdovers from the Obama administration .\nIraq 's Foreign Ministry welcomed reports of its removal from the list of countries affected by the travel ban .\n`` ( The ) Iraqi Foreign Ministry expresses deep relief regarding the executive order that was issued by the American president Donald Trump , which excludes the Iraqis from the travel ban to the United States , '' said Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesperson , Ahmad Jamal . `` This is considered an important step in the right direction that strengthen and reinforces the strategic alliance between Baghdad and Washington in many fields , in particular the fight against terrorism .

That failure raised questions about the new White House's capacity to govern and to master the political intricacies needed to manage complicated political endeavors in Washington. It also brought Trump into conflict with the judiciary in the first sign of how constitutional checks and balances could challenge his vision of a powerful presidency built on expansive executive authority.\n\nThe original order came under intense criticism as an attempt to bar Muslims from entering the country, and Trump's call during the campaign for a \"Muslim Ban\" was cited in court cases attacking the ban.\n\nThe new order does not prioritize religious minorities when considering refugee admissions cases.\n\nAdministration officials Monday stressed they do not see the ban as targeting a specific religion.\n\n\"(The order is) not any way targeted as a Muslim ban ... we want to make sure everyone understands that,\" an official told reporters.\n\n\"The Department of Justice believes that this executive order just as the first executive order is a lawful and proper exercise of presidential authority,\" Sessions said.\n\nDemocrats responded by calling Trump's order a repeat version of the first attempt.\n\n\"Here we go again...Muslim Ban 2.0 #NoBanNoWall\" tweeted Rep. Andre Carson of Indiana, one of two Muslims serving in the House of Representatives.\n\nWorking to contain fallout\n\nThe newly crafted order also revealed that the administration wasn't just paying attention to the legal criticism in the courts, but also recalibrating in light of the heavy political fire they faced after the first order's messy rollout.\n\nWhile administration lawyers argued the original travel ban went into effect immediately to prevent terrorists from rushing into the country, the revised ban will phase in after 10 days. The previous order will be rescinded on that date.\n\nTrump had previously said he opposed giving any advance notice of the ban.\n\n\"If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the \"bad\" would rush into our country during that week. A lot of bad \"dudes\" out there!\" he tweeted on January 30\n\nThe White House also abandoned the sense of urgency with which it implemented the first travel ban, delaying the signing of a new executive order multiple times over the last three weeks. Politics also came into play as White House officials delayed the signing from last Wednesday in part to allow positive coverage of the President's joint address to Congress to continue uninterrupted.\n\n\"We want the (executive order) to have its own 'moment,'\" a senior administration official told CNN last week.\n\nThe President signed the action Monday morning without the fanfare he has given to other executive orders. No media was present during the signing at the White House, an administration official confirmed. White House spokesman Sean Spicer tweeted a picture of Trump signing the order.\n\nWhite House officials collaborated for several weeks with officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and kept congressional leaders apprised of their progress this time around after the White House drew a backlash for keeping Congress and relevant federal agencies almost entirely in the dark during the first rollout.\n\nTo bolster its national security claims, the new executive order also states FBI has reported that approximately 300 people who entered the United States as refugees are \"currently the subjects of counter-terrorism investigations.\"\n\n\"The fact remains that we are not immune to terrorist threats and that our enemies often use our own freedoms and generosity against us,\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said. \"We cannot risk the prospect of malevolent actors using our immigration system to take American lives.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, said the ban \"has the same fundamental flaws\" as the first order.\n\n\"We know that country of origin is a poor predictor of a propensity to commit acts of terror. If it were, Pakistan has been a far more problematic source of attack planning and would be at the top of the President's list, but that country merits not even a mention in the order,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nWhy Iraq was removed\n\nBut the new order was also delayed in part because of a debate within the administration over how to handle Iraq.\n\nTillerson, Secretary of Defense James Mattis and national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster had all advocated for Iraq to be removed from the Trump administration's list of banned countries in the new executive order for diplomatic reasons, including Iraq's role in fighting ISIS, sources told CNN's Elise Labott and Evan Perez. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly also supported the move.\n\nIraq was removed from the revised travel ban executive order after intensive lobbying from the Iraqi government at the highest levels, according to a senior US official.\n\nThat included a phone call between Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on February 10 and an in-person conversation between Abadi and Vice President Mike Pence in Munich on February 18.\n\nThose conversations were followed by discussions between Tillerson and members of the Iraqi government about vetting measures in place that would prevent suspected terrorists from leaving Iraq and coming to the United States. Iraq did not implement new measures; rather, the country provided more detail to US officials about how it screens travelers.\n\nIn Trump's call with Abadi, the President vowed to seek a resolution to his counterpart's concerns about his citizens' being unable to enter the United States, according to a readout of the phone call from Baghdad. The US official said Trump asked Tillerson to get greater clarity on vetting measures in Iraq.\n\nTrump also faced pressure to remove Iraq from the order from some American national security officials, who argued the restriction burdened a key anti-ISIS partner. Some of those voices were holdovers from the Obama administration.\n\nIraq's Foreign Ministry welcomed reports of its removal from the list of countries affected by the travel ban.\n\n\"(The) Iraqi Foreign Ministry expresses deep relief regarding the executive order that was issued by the American president Donald Trump, which excludes the Iraqis from the travel ban to the United States,\" said Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ahmad Jamal. \"This is considered an important step in the right direction that strengthen and reinforces the strategic alliance between Baghdad and Washington in many fields, in particular the fight against terrorism.\"\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct Kelly's name.",

Parts of the interior, including the oxygen tank, were brought to the nearest town, Pangkalan Bun. Another find included a bright blue plastic suitcase, completely unscratched.\n\n\"I know the plane has crashed, but I cannot believe my brother and his family are dead,\" said Ifan Joko, who lost seven family members, three of them children, as they traveled to Singapore to ring in the new year. \"We still pray they are alive.\"\n\nThe corpses were spotted about 160 kilometers (100 miles) from Central Kalimantan province.\n\nRescue workers descended on ropes from a hovering helicopter to retrieve bodies. Efforts were hindered by 2-meter (6-foot) waves and strong winds, National Search and Rescue Director SB Supriyadi said.\n\nThe first body was later picked up by a navy ship. Officials said as many as six others followed, but they disagreed about the exact number.\n\nSupriyadi was on the aircraft and saw what appeared to be more wreckage under the water, which was clear and a relatively shallow 20 to 30 meters (65 to 100 feet).\n\nWhen TV broadcast an image of a half-naked man floating in the water, a shirt partially covering his head, many of the family members screamed and wailed uncontrollably. One middle-aged man collapsed and had to be carried out on a stretcher.\n\nAbout 125 family members were planning to travel Wednesday to Pangkalan Bun to start identifying their loved ones. Body bags and coffins have been prepared at three hospitals there. Dozens of elite military divers also joined the search.\n\nMalaysia-based AirAsia's loss comes on top of the still-unsolved disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March with 239 people aboard, and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine, which killed all 298 passengers and crew.\n\nNearly all the passengers and crew were Indonesians, who are frequent visitors to Singapore, particularly on holidays.\n\nHaidar Fauzie, 60, said his youngest child and only daughter, Khairunnisa Haidar, was a flight attendant who had worked with AirAsia for two years.\n\nOn learning about the crash, he struggled to console his grieving wife. They last saw their child six weeks ago, when she returned home on holiday.\n\n\"From the start, we already knew the risks associated with being a stewardess,\" Fauzie said. \"She is beautiful and smart. It has always been her dream to fly. We couldn't have stopped her.\"\n\nAirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes, the airline's founder and public face and a constant presence in Indonesia since the tragedy started unfolding, said he planned to travel to the recovery site on Wednesday.\n\n\"I have apologized profusely for what they are going through,\" he said of his contact with relatives. \"I am the leader of this company, and I have to take responsibility. That is why I'm here. I'm not running away from my obligations.\"\n\nThe jet's last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later, the jet disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal.\n\nSeveral countries rushed to Indonesia to help with search and recovery efforts.\n\nThe United States said it was sending the USS Sampson destroyer, joining at least 30 ships, 15 aircraft and seven helicopters in the search for the jet.\n\nA Chinese frigate was on the way. Singapore said it was sending two underwater beacon detectors to try to pick up pings from the plane's all-important cockpit voice and flight-data recorders. Malaysia, Australia and Thailand are also involved in the search.",

Leahy said he anticipates an \"open and transparent\" process with \"public proceedings,\" but also stressed that the committee has held dozens of hearings on the issue.\n\n\"If any of the more junior senators need more time to get up to speed, I will look forward to them discussing their specific readiness problems with me directly,\" he wrote.\n\nSessions interpreted this as a signal the chairman does not want to hold new hearings.\n\nReferencing the health care overhaul legislation -- which Republicans maintain was rushed through Congress -- Sessions said \"never again can Congress pass a far-reaching proposal only for the American people to find out what's in it later.\"\n\nSessions said the immigration reform process, at the committee level alone, should take months, not weeks.\n\n\"It is one thing to make promises, it is quite another to write a bill that actually works,\" Sessions said in a statement.\n\nIt's unclear whether Democrats, who control the Senate, would agree to such a drawn-out timetable. Negotiators hope to introduce a bill, or the framework for a bill, later this month. President Obama has listed the legislation as a priority for his second term. As gun control legislation appears to falter, the White House and leading advocates for reform are likely to lean on the Senate to move the legislation forward.\n\nAt the same time, the bill will have to have enough bipartisan buy-in to make it attractive -- or at least acceptable -- to the Republican-dominated House.\n\nThough Rubio has lately urged Democratic leaders to slow things down, Schumer said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he doesn't think Rubio will \"walk away.\"\n\n\"He is protecting some of the things that he thinks are very important in the bill. But I don't think that'll stand in the way in any way of any final agreement,\" Schumer said.",

        "content": "House Republicans still smarting from their poor showing among Hispanics in the U.S. presidential election are planning a vote next week on immigration legislation that would both expand visas for foreign science and technology students and make it easier for those with green cards to bring their immediate families to the U.S .\nRepublican leaders made it clear after the election that the party was ready to get serious about overhauling the nation 's dysfunctional immigration system , a top priority for Hispanic communities . Taking up what is called the STEM Jobs Act during the lame-duck session could be seen as a first step in that direction .\nThe House voted on a STEM bill -- standing for science , technology , engineering and mathematics -- in September , but under a procedure requiring a two-thirds majority . It was defeated , with more than 80 percent of Democrats voting against it , because it offset the increase in visas for high-tech graduates by eliminating another visa program that is available for less-educated foreigners , many from Africa .\nRepublicans are changing the formula this time by adding a provision long sought by some immigration advocates -- expanding a program that allows the spouses and minor children of people with permanent residence , or green card , to wait in the United States for their own green cards to be granted .\nThere are some 80,000 of these family-based green cards allocated every year , but there are currently about 322,000 husbands , wives and children waiting in this category and on average people must wait more than two years to be reunited with their families . In that past that wait could be as long as six years .\nThe House proposal would allow family members to come to the U.S. one year after they apply for their green cards , but they would n't be able to work until they actually got the card . It applies to the families of green card holders who marry after getting their residency permits .\nBruce Morrison , a former Democratic congressman who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and authored a 1990 immigration law , said the bill neither increases the number of green cards nor gives people green cards early . But people `` get the most important benefit of being able to live legally in the United States with their spouses . ''\nMorrison , an immigration policy lobbyist who advocates for groups such as American Families United , called the bill a stepping-stone to more comprehensive immigration reform , That Republicans initiated it `` to me is a positive gesture that they want to do business on this subject , '' he said .\nMegan Whittemore , spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , a key proponent of the STEM Act , said the bill is `` family friendly , helping spouses and minor children who would otherwise be separated from their families for extended periods of time .

        "content_original": "House Republicans still smarting from their poor showing among Hispanics in the U.S. presidential election are planning a vote next week on immigration legislation that would both expand visas for foreign science and technology students and make it easier for those with green cards to bring their immediate families to the U.S.\n\nRepublican leaders made it clear after the election that the party was ready to get serious about overhauling the nation's dysfunctional immigration system, a top priority for Hispanic communities. Taking up what is called the STEM Jobs Act during the lame-duck session could be seen as a first step in that direction.\n\nThe House voted on a STEM bill -- standing for science, technology, engineering and mathematics -- in September, but under a procedure requiring a two-thirds majority. It was defeated, with more than 80 percent of Democrats voting against it, because it offset the increase in visas for high-tech graduates by eliminating another visa program that is available for less-educated foreigners, many from Africa.\n\nRepublicans are changing the formula this time by adding a provision long sought by some immigration advocates -- expanding a program that allows the spouses and minor children of people with permanent residence, or green card, to wait in the United States for their own green cards to be granted.\n\nThere are some 80,000 of these family-based green cards allocated every year, but there are currently about 322,000 husbands, wives and children waiting in this category and on average people must wait more than two years to be reunited with their families. In that past that wait could be as long as six years.\n\nThe House proposal would allow family members to come to the U.S. one year after they apply for their green cards, but they wouldn't be able to work until they actually got the card. It applies to the families of green card holders who marry after getting their residency permits.\n\nBruce Morrison, a former Democratic congressman who chaired the House immigration subcommittee and authored a 1990 immigration law, said the bill neither increases the number of green cards nor gives people green cards early. But people \"get the most important benefit of being able to live legally in the United States with their spouses.\"\n\nMorrison, an immigration policy lobbyist who advocates for groups such as American Families United, called the bill a stepping-stone to more comprehensive immigration reform, That Republicans initiated it \"to me is a positive gesture that they want to do business on this subject,\" he said.\n\nMegan Whittemore, spokeswoman for House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a key proponent of the STEM Act, said the bill is \"family friendly, helping spouses and minor children who would otherwise be separated from their families for extended periods of time.\"\n\nThe bill will be taken up this time under normal procedures requiring only a majority vote, and it is almost certain to pass the Republican-led House. It remains to be seen whether it will engender enough Democratic support to give it momentum as it heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nIt would give 55,000 green cards a year to doctoral and masters graduates in the STEM fields.

        "content": "President Trump on Thursday denied reports that he struck a `` deal '' overnight with top Democrats to protect so-called \u201c Dreamers , \u201d while insisting \u201c massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s Twitter post was in response to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , announcing after a dinner meeting at the White House that they had `` agreed to a plan to work out an agreement to protect our nation \u2019 s DREAMers from deportation . ''\nThey also said `` we would review border security measures that didn \u2019 t include building a wall . ''\nThe president clarified Thursday morning that he intends for the wall to be built -- and while he wants to helps Dreamers , there 's no deal yet .\n`` No deal was made last night on DACA . Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent . Would be subject to vote , '' Trump tweeted . `` The WALL , which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls , will continue to be built . ''\nTrump , on the ground in Florida to survey hurricane damage , later told reporters they were \u201c fairly close \u201d on a deal but insisted a border wall \u201c is vital. \u201d He said they must have an understanding in some legislation to fund the wall , \u201c otherwise we \u2019 re not doing anything . \u201d\nPelosi and Schumer called Wednesday night 's dinner at the White House \u201c very productive . ''\nShortly after their statement , the White House issued its own statement agreeing that the sit-down was productive , but the exclusion of the border wall `` was certainly not agreed to . ''\nTrump , before and after the dinner meeting , has voiced concern about the fate of the young illegal immigrants who had been protected under the Obama-era DACA program that he aims to reverse . The program shielded illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation . While Trump is rolling back the executive action that allowed it , he is giving Congress time to pass a legislative alternative -- a point he underscored Thursday .\n`` Does anybody really want to throw out good , educated and accomplished young people who have jobs , some serving in the military ? Really ! ... They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age . Plus BIG border security , '' he tweeted .\nPelosi and Schumer , though , tried to dial down tensions by mid-morning , releasing a joint statement suggesting they \u2019 re actually all on the same page .\n\u201c President Trump \u2019 s Tweets are not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night , \u201d they said . \u201c As we said last night , there was no final deal , but there was agreement on \u201d working to protect Dreamers with legislation .\nThey said they agreed the wall would not be part of this agreement , though Trump wants to pursue it later , and both sides agreed to \u201c work out a border security package . \u201d\nTensions between the White House and top Democrats remain on the issue , despite the dinner meeting .\nPelosi 's Twitter account still has a pinned tweet that reads : `` Trump \u2019 s cowardice is on full display today . His cruelty must not stand ! # ProtectDREAMERS . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier Wednesday that Trump was \u201c committed to the wall . It doesn \u2019 t have to be tied to DACA , but it 's important and he will get it done . \u201d\nMatt House , Schumer \u2019 s communications director , responded on Twitter : \u201c The President made clear he would continue pushing the wall , just not as part of this agreement . \u201d\nThe New York Times cited a White House official who said Trump pushed for border wall funding at the meeting .\nBeside the border wall issue , the Democrats said Trump agreed to enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from the DACA program .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan , who also sat down with Pelosi to talk immigration Wednesday , said in an interview that deporting the so-called Dreamers was \u201c not in our nation \u2019 s interest , \u201d and said the president had \u201c made the right call . \u201d\n\u201c I wanted him to give us time . I didn \u2019 t want this to be rescinded on Day One and create chaos , \u201d Ryan said , arguing the time would allow Congress to \u201c come up with the right kind of consensus and compromise to fix this problem . \u201d\nThe dinner took place in the White House \u2019 s Blue Room , sources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The Congress members sat at a rectangular table with Trump at the head with Pelosi to his right , and Schumer to his left . Eleven people were in the room , sources said . The first half-hour addressed trade issues with China .\nThe meeting between the three came shortly after Trump overruled congressional Republicans and cut a deal with Democrats to raise the federal debt ceiling for three months .

        "content_original": "President Trump on Thursday denied reports that he struck a \"deal\" overnight with top Democrats to protect so-called \u201cDreamers,\u201d while insisting \u201cmassive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Twitter post was in response to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announcing after a dinner meeting at the White House that they had \"agreed to a plan to work out an agreement to protect our nation\u2019s DREAMers from deportation.\"\n\nThey also said \"we would review border security measures that didn\u2019t include building a wall.\"\n\nThe president clarified Thursday morning that he intends for the wall to be built -- and while he wants to helps Dreamers, there's no deal yet.\n\n\"No deal was made last night on DACA. Massive border security would have to be agreed to in exchange for consent. Would be subject to vote,\" Trump tweeted. \"The WALL, which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls, will continue to be built.\"\n\nTrump, on the ground in Florida to survey hurricane damage, later told reporters they were \u201cfairly close\u201d on a deal but insisted a border wall \u201cis vital.\u201d He said they must have an understanding in some legislation to fund the wall, \u201cotherwise we\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d\n\nPelosi and Schumer called Wednesday night's dinner at the White House \u201cvery productive.\"\n\nShortly after their statement, the White House issued its own statement agreeing that the sit-down was productive, but the exclusion of the border wall \"was certainly not agreed to.\"\n\nTrump, before and after the dinner meeting, has voiced concern about the fate of the young illegal immigrants who had been protected under the Obama-era DACA program that he aims to reverse. The program shielded illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children from deportation. While Trump is rolling back the executive action that allowed it, he is giving Congress time to pass a legislative alternative -- a point he underscored Thursday.\n\n\"Does anybody really want to throw out good, educated and accomplished young people who have jobs, some serving in the military? Really! ... They have been in our country for many years through no fault of their own - brought in by parents at young age. Plus BIG border security,\" he tweeted.\n\nPelosi and Schumer, though, tried to dial down tensions by mid-morning, releasing a joint statement suggesting they\u2019re actually all on the same page.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Tweets are not inconsistent with the agreement reached last night,\u201d they said. \u201cAs we said last night, there was no final deal, but there was agreement on\u201d working to protect Dreamers with legislation.\n\nThey said they agreed the wall would not be part of this agreement, though Trump wants to pursue it later, and both sides agreed to \u201cwork out a border security package.\u201d\n\nTensions between the White House and top Democrats remain on the issue, despite the dinner meeting.\n\nPelosi's Twitter account still has a pinned tweet that reads: \"Trump\u2019s cowardice is on full display today. His cruelty must not stand! #ProtectDREAMERS.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said earlier Wednesday that Trump was \u201ccommitted to the wall. It doesn\u2019t have to be tied to DACA, but it's important and he will get it done.\u201d\n\nMatt House, Schumer\u2019s communications director, responded on Twitter: \u201cThe President made clear he would continue pushing the wall, just not as part of this agreement.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times cited a White House official who said Trump pushed for border wall funding at the meeting.\n\nBeside the border wall issue, the Democrats said Trump agreed to enshrine protections for the nearly 800,000 immigrants brought illegally to this country as kids who had benefited from the DACA program.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who also sat down with Pelosi to talk immigration Wednesday, said in an interview that deporting the so-called Dreamers was \u201cnot in our nation\u2019s interest,\u201d and said the president had \u201cmade the right call.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted him to give us time. I didn\u2019t want this to be rescinded on Day One and create chaos,\u201d Ryan said, arguing the time would allow Congress to \u201ccome up with the right kind of consensus and compromise to fix this problem.\u201d\n\nThe dinner took place in the White House\u2019s Blue Room, sources told Fox News. The Congress members sat at a rectangular table with Trump at the head with Pelosi to his right, and Schumer to his left. Eleven people were in the room, sources said. The first half-hour addressed trade issues with China.\n\nThe meeting between the three came shortly after Trump overruled congressional Republicans and cut a deal with Democrats to raise the federal debt ceiling for three months. Some conservatives criticized the deal as a capitulation by Trump.\n\nTrump, however, appears to see bipartisanship as a key to get legislation out of the starting gate.\n\n\u201cMore and more we\u2019re trying to work things out together,\u201d Trump explained Wednesday, calling the development a \u201cpositive thing\u201d for both parties.\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest legislation ever passed, it was done on a bipartisan manner. And so that is why we\u2019re going to give it a shot,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",
